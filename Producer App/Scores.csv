4.6,3,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, 3 runs, length, and he flicks it off his pads towards mid-wicket. There's a fielder there, Shikhar Dhawan, who misfields. Has to chase this all the way to the fence, and he's able to pull it back just in time to prevent four"
4.5,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, length, angles back into him, and he defends this towards cover"
4.4,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, length, driven back towards Shami, who picks it up on his follow-through"

3.4,2,"Bumrah to Finch, 2 runs, hint of movement back in, and he uses that to nurdle this towards deep backward square leg. Hard running brings an easy two"
3.3,4,"Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs, gorgeous! The length is good, but not as full as what you would consider ideal for the drive. There's a bit of movement back in, and with that Finch just throws his hands at it and strokes it through cover"
3.2,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, shorter, a bit of shape back in, and he cuts this towards point"
3.1,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, length, around off, and he drives this towards point"
2.6,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, ooh, a beauty! Like a very fast off-break, this pitches around off, and then moves away in the air. Warner half-stretches forward to defend, and sees this whizz past his outside edge, through to KL Rahul behind the stumps. Remember again, no Pant"
2.5,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, length, nips back in a touch, and he defends from the crease"
2.4,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, full, wide, and he smashes this hard through cover, but the fielder there is quick to cut this off"

2.2,4,"Mohammed Shami to Finch, FOUR runs, inswinger, but he stretches and smashes this through covers. Top shot from Finch! A short movement forward with his front foot, and then just going with the shot as he would normally do. It's been a mode of dismissal exploited by India in the past, but not this time"
2.1,1,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, 1 run, strays down the pads, and he can whip it off his legs towards long leg. Wants two, but has to settle for one as the fielder converges quickly from fine leg"
1.6,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, length, a hint of movement back in. Finch wants to press forward to defend, and the inward movement makes the bat skew as he blocks"
1.5,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, length, jags back in from outside off, and Finch leaves it. Trusts the bounce on this surface, but that wasn't far away from the top of off!"
1.4,2,"Bumrah to Finch, 2 runs, shorter, and he goes on top of his toes to ride the bounce. Pushes this through the cover-point region, and picks up two before Pandey can pull it back in"
1.3,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, length, and he defends this incoming ball towards point"
1.2,1,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 leg bye, shorter, and he looks to flick this away. Off his pads, and pops up around square leg. They pick up a leg bye before the fielder can bring it in"

0.1,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, length, just around off, and he punches this towards cover, where substitute fielder Manish Pandey stops it"
49.1,7,"Richardson to Mohammed Shami, OUT, length ball at the stumps, backs away and looks to smash across, gets a top edge that goes high and behind the stumps, Carey positions himself under it as it comes spiralling down, the ball pops out of his gloves but he does well to cling to the rebound, between his chin/neck and the glove"
48.6,7,"Starc to Mohammed Shami, OUT, a direct hit from Smith and Kuldeep has to go back. Fuller outside off, Shami steered it towards backward point and set off, Smith had all the time to nail the direct hit and he does"

47.4,1,"Richardson to Kuldeep Yadav, 1 run, slower length ball, backs away and tucks it towards midwicket, Richardson chases himself but Shami is charging down for the second. The throw is at the wrong end and there is enough time for Shami to retrace his steps"

44.5,7,"Starc to Thakur, OUT, nails the yorker, it was just a matter of time, Shardul fails to get anything on it and the off stump has been knocked out from its groove. The fact that Shardul was looking to play across the line didn't help eithert"
44.4,1,"Starc to Mohammed Shami, 1 run, fuller at the stumps, Shami gets his bat on it this time, driven towards sweeper cover"
44.3,0,"Starc to Mohammed Shami, no run, another attempted yorker, just outside off this time, Shami looks to drive but misses"
44.2,0,"Starc to Mohammed Shami, no run, Michael Gough gives it lbw. Shami though wants to review it. Has to. A yorker from around the wicket, Shami misses the flick and it hits him right on the shoe. No bat involved but looks like it was going down. Replays show the impact was in the line of the leg stump but the angle would have taken it down. Shami survives"
44.1,1,"Starc to Thakur, 1 run, dropped. A full toss at the stumps and lofted towards long-on, not from the middle of the bat. Richardson charges in, a low chance but should have been taken, slips through his fingers"
43.6,1,"Cummins to Thakur, 1 run, short of length at the batsman and another good short, pulled towards in front of square leg, keeps the strike with that single"

38.6,2,"Cummins to Jadeja, 2 runs, short of length outside off, dabs it towards the left of the third man, and he is sprinting back for the second. A direct hit and they are checking upstairs. Richardson is the fielder but Jadeja was dragging his bat and was well inside"

Driven hard, to a ball that was floated around off, and he just couldn't keep it away from Zampa, who takes a sharp chance and then punches the air. Important breakthrough for Australia at this stage, as it exposes the relatively soft underbelly of the Indian batting, with a good way to cover in this innings"
31.1,6,"Zampa to Kohli, SIX runs, very short ball, and gets the right treatment! Rocks back, and swings this over the long leg fence. Just went over, in the end, but good enough to fetch half a dozen"

28.5,7,"Cummins to Dhawan, OUT, Dhawan goes! Must have been a change of pace, because Dhawan got that nowhere near where he wanted to play it. Just looks to flick it away, and the outside edge carries it towards cover. Ashton Agar runs in from mid-off and takes a good, diving catch away to his right. The set man is gone, as the bowling change makes a difference immediately for Finch!"

27.5,0,"Agar to Kohli, no run, length, and he stretches to drive towards cover"

27.2,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, drives hard towards long-off, with a good forward stride in towards the ball"
27.1,7,"Agar to Rahul, OUT, GONE! Chips a length ball in the air, just doesn't get to the pitch of one floated around off. Perhaps gripped a bit on the pitch too, and he just drives this straight to Steve Smith at cover. Loud cheers, as the crowd prepare for Virat Kohli"

26.3,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, length, punched towards deep point"
26.2,1,"Richardson to Dhawan, 1 run, short, scrambled-seam from the look of things, and he plays it towards point. A slight misfield, and the ball does go wide enough to allow a run to be pinched"
26.1,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, fuller length, and he plays a gorgeous drive, just to the left of mid-off. Cummins fields and has a shy at the non-striker's end. Just misses, though Rahul was well in"
25.6,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, length, driven out towards sweeper cover"
25.5,0,"Zampa to Rahul, no run, this is interesting. The ball goes through Rahul, looks to have taken a little tickle, and then Carey comes up with a good take.

25.4,0,"Zampa to Rahul, no run, length, driven back towards the bowler"
25.3,0,"Zampa to Rahul, no run, shorter, and he goes back and drives it back towards the bowler"

24.4,1,"Agar to Dhawan, 1 run, tapped away towards square leg for a quick single"

0.4,0,"Starc to Sharma, no run, a direct hit and Rohit would have been out. Was fuller again, Rohit nudges it to the left of Warner at mid-off and sets off. Dhawan sends him back but Warner has a shy at the striker's end. Rohit is well short but Warner fails to nail it"

40.1,4,"Bumrah to Agar, FOUR runs, good length ball angled across fourth stump, Agar just dabs this with the angle toward Saini at deep third man, didn't have far to go to cut this off but Saini looking gimpy all night on that left ankle and it beats him easily."
39.6,2,"Mohammed Shami to Turner, 2 runs, they scamper back for two, taking on the long-on fielder. 7 off that over, and here's Peter to take you to the finish"
39.5,0,"Mohammed Shami to Turner, no run, well bowled. Full ball defended straight back to Shami"

39.3,0,"Mohammed Shami to Agar, no run, aggressive bouncer, Agar gets out of the way"
39.2,1,"Mohammed Shami to Turner, 1 leg bye, huge appeal from India. Full delivery that struck Turner on the toe, but umpire unconvinced. India review It's missing leg stump. Australia still retain that glimmer of hope"
39.1,2,"Mohammed Shami to Turner, 2 runs, muscled away to the on-side for a couple. Turner needs to have a go soon."
38.6,1,"Bumrah to Turner, 1 run, sharp running. Turner keeps the strike as the asking rate moves above 10"
38.5,4,"Bumrah to Turner, 4 leg byes, legbyes for four. Much, much needed for Australia. Slightly misdirected from Bumrah for once, and it beats the man at fine leg"
38.4,1,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 run, nicely timed down the ground"
38.3,0,"Bumrah to Agar, no run, thick outside edge. Another slower delivery, and it goes through to Rahul on the bounce"

38.1,1,"Bumrah to Turner, 1 run, worked to square leg. With Bumrah, India looking for the killer blow"
37.6,0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Agar, no run, blocked. Match-turning over, surely"
37.5,7,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, OUT, what an over this is! Smith falls two runs shy of a 100! Nothing in the delivery, really, but Smith plays on. Kuldeep is making a difference after an indifferent day up to this over. Is this the game?"
37.4,0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, no run, beats him with the googly. Another tight over, this"
37.3,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Turner, 1 run, off the mark with a backfoot punch"
37.2,7,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, OUT, the softest of dismissals, and Rajkot breathes again. Checked his shot instead of going through with it, and it goes straight to extra cover for the simplest catch. 100 wickets for Kuldeep Yadav"
37.1,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 1 run, eased onto the onside. 2 runs away now"
36.6,1,"Saini to Smith, 1 run, the bounce beats him again. Thick inside edge. Saini's rescued the over somewhat after the boundary"

36.4,0,"Saini to Smith, no run, defended back to the bowler"

35.1,0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, no run, defended"
34.6,1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, and keeps the strike. A couple of excellent overs for Australia. Runs coming without too many risks"
34.5,6,"Jadeja to Smith, SIX runs, makes up for it, and then some! Who said Smith doesn't have power hitting ability. Right from the middle and it goes 90 METRES into the stands"

33.4,6,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, SIX runs, that's what Carey should be doing more. Gets down low and smears it over cow corner. Not middled, but it still comfortably sails over the rope and into the stands"

32.1,1,"Jadeja to Carey, 1 run, another reverse sweep, but a diving Chahal prevents three. Excellent fielding"
31.6,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 1 run, nice drive. Four off the Kuldeep over, and the asking rate begins to rise once more"

31.3,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 1 run, now the regular sweep, and a misfield at short fine leg gets him off the mark"

30.5,7,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT, and that's the wicket! Rajkot erupts! He is furious with himself! Came down the track but seemed caught in two minds as regards to whether he should chip it or look to clear the mid-off fielder. Ends up as the most comfortable catch for Mohammad Shami. Huge, huge scalp"
30.4,1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, better ball, pushes Smith back, but he manages to work it away for a run"
30.3,4,"Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs, no timing, that was uppish, just out of Jadeja's reach. It goes all the way for four, though, and you can hear a pin drop"

28.4,1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, full on middle, driven to long-on."
28.3,0,"Jadeja to Smith, no run, stone dead! Has to be! Given not out! Kohli calls for the review. Smith did his traditional back and across but missed in front of middle stump halfway up just above the knee roll but very deep in his crease. DRS ball-tracking shows... Umpire's call clipping the leg bails! Extremely brave from umpire Kettleborough to give that not out on field."

26.6,4,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, FOUR runs, overpitched with more air at 89 kph and dragged wide on sixth stump, plenty of width for Labuschagne to drive aerially over extra cover, long-off has no chance running across. Spectacular shot. Shades of KL Rahul's six in the first innings."

25.2,0,"Saini to Smith, no run, good length ball defended to point."

24.5,0,"Jadeja to Smith, no run, good length ball defended to point."
24.4,4,"Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs, good length on middle, goes back to flick past short fine leg, enough pace off the ball from Jadeja at 97 kph to just use it and work it behind square for a smart boundary."

24.2,0,"Jadeja to Smith, no run, full on middle and driven back to Jadeja."

19.4,1,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 1 run, comfortably flicked down to the onside"

19.1,1,"Mohammed Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run, opens the face of the blade and eases it to third man. The pace is back because these two looked so settled against spin"
18.6,4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, FOUR runs, How good is that shot? Pretty darn good, I'd say. Picks the line and length early, moves across, and absolutely bludgeons a slog-sweep for four. This is a nice little spell for Australia"

18.4,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 1 run, another wrong'un, but starts it outside leg stump. Flicked down to fine leg"

17.3,1,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run, sloppy fielding. Good delivery, but of flight and turn, but the bowler and mid-off get into a bit of a tangle, presenting the opportunity to steal a run"
17.2,2,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 2 runs, sliced to backward point and the two scamper back for a couple"
17.1,1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, worked away to the onside"

15.1,7,"Jadeja to Finch, OUT, have they got their man? Yes, they have! Finch opened his body up to smash it over extra cover, but was beaten by the turn. Excellent glovework by KL Rahul, who whips the bails off while Finch's foot is on the line. Incredibly tight call, but I think giving it out is the right one. Dhoni would have been proud of that"
14.6,2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 2 runs, another wrong-un, Smith lobs this into the air with the turn. The in-fielder on the offside thought he was in with a chance but it's well out of his grasp. Eight off that over"

14.1,2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 2 runs, starts off with a loosener outside leg, which Smith easily guides to square leg"
13.6,2,"Saini to Finch, 2 runs, prods it into the onside and hares back for two. Could Finch finally be on his way to a big score?"
13.5,4,"Saini to Finch, FOUR runs, a gimme ball that Finch gratefully accepts. Pace onto his pad, allowing Finch to hop across and put it away behind square leg. Big pressure reliever, that"

13.3,1,"Saini to Finch, 1 run, blocks and runs. Finch isn't quite finding the timing at the moment"

11.5,0,"Saini to Finch, no run, short ball, swing and a miss"
11.4,1,"Saini to Smith, 1 run, big runout chance. Smith bloacked and ran, and a diving Rohit Sharma simply needed to hit the stumps. Suicidal running, gets away with it"
11.3,1,"Saini to Finch, 1 run, driven to mid-on and the pair swap ends"
11.2,0,"Saini to Finch, no run, nice line. Doesn't give him enough room to open up the offside - not far away from taking his edge"
11.1,0,"Saini to Finch, no run, full, wicket-to-wicket line. Finch thought about running, but thought better of it"

9.1,0,"Saini to Smith, no run, fullish length on off stump, Smith goes back and across to punch to mid-on."
8.6,1,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 1 leg bye, short on the hips, tries to flick behind square but can't get bat on it. Carom goes short enough of short fine leg to allow a tight run."

5.5,1,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 1 leg bye, short of a length ball on off, out in front of a pull, hit on the ribs and they pinch a run into short midwicket."
5.4,0,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, no run, huge lbw shout! This looked very close with Smith shuffling across defending down the wrong line. Given not out. Kohli opts against the review. Was touch and go whether he was hit in line with the stumps, replays show he was hit just outside off"
5.3,3,"Mohammed Shami to Finch, 3 runs, in the slot on off, shovels this high over extra cover, chased down before the rope by Pandey."
5.2,2,"Mohammed Shami to Finch, 2 runs, back of a length outside off, floats the bat to chip this behind point, slack fielding at deep third man by Kuldeep to relay in and they alertly take a second."
5.1,1,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 1 run, short on the legs, pulled flat just wide of Rohit at short fine leg. Would've been a stunner had he been able to get a hand to it diving right."
4.6,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, good length on off, punched off the back foot to extra cover. Maiden for Bumrah."
4.5,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, good length on fifth stump angling in, tries to cut but cramped for room, chops it down past off stump into the ground to the keeper."
4.4,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, short and wide, cut straight to backward point."
4.3,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, good length seams back beating the bat and zips into his thigh guard to carom to slip."

3.3,0,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, no run, good length ball on the stumps, defended."
3.3,1,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 1 wide, bouncer goes down leg."
3.2,7,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, OUT, Pandey! The Barracuda! Length ball angled across fifth stump, Warner spanks this flat toward cover, didn't look like he wanted to keep it down but didn't get the elevation either. Pandey on the ring times his leap perfectly to intercept it with his right hand reaching high over his head. 10/10 from the Swiss, the Russian, the French and the Brazilian judges. Nonchalant flick in the air after the catch before being mobbed by Jadeja and Shreyas. Warner cracks a grin. That was special."
3.1,4,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, FOUR runs, short on sixth stump, Warner goes for the full pull shot instead of the short arm jab this time, drags this high over midwicket with a lot of wrist power and it bounces away to the rope."
2.6,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, gem! Back of a length ball on fourth stump, Finch goes to punch through cover off the back foot, beaten by extra bounce."
2.5,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, in the slot on sixth stump, square drives this straight to backward point."

2.2,0,"Bumrah to Finch, no run, another hooping inswinger pitches on off on a good length and slams Finch into the pads, missing leg, can't get it away."
2.2,5,"Bumrah to Finch, 5 wides, full and swinging down leg big time, Rahul dives left but it keeps on swinging all the way to the rope. 5 freebies to the Aussies."
2.1,1,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run, short on the legs, flicked behind square to deep fine leg where Kedar Jadhav fields, on as a sub for Saini."
1.6,0,"Mohammed Shami to Finch, no run, short on the stumps, defended into the off side."
1.5,3,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, 3 runs, short of a length outside off, short arm jab pull over wide mid-on, didn't complete the flourish and it is tracked down by Saini short of the rope. Saini is now clutching his left ankle.  He's down for a minute but gets back up now. He's come off for a sub."
1.4,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, short on the legs, tapped off the back foot into short midwicket."
1.3,0,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, no run, short of a length ball on off stump, defended into short mid-off, chased down by Shami."
1.2,4,"Mohammed Shami to Warner, FOUR runs, fullish length swinging in a touch on fourth stump, firm forward press and this flies off the bat through extra cover. What timing."

0.1,0,"Bumrah to Warner, no run, good length ball on off, defended back to Bumrah."
49.6,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run, smashed straight to the cover fielder, and they run one. That gets India to 340."
49.5,1,"Starc to Mohammed Shami, 1 run, yorker. Shami does well to get enough bat on it to get Jadeja on strike"
49.4,7,"Starc to Jadeja, OUT, and that's Rahul gone. Well done for being so unselfish, to be fair. Went through to the keeper and Rahul as desperate to get back on strike. Carey got the direct hit; a diving Rahul was well out of his crease"
49.3,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 bye, misses it completely. Slower ball and a wild hoick that goes through to the keeper. They run a bye Australia aren't too concerned with preventing"
49.2,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run, pull shot gets Rahul back on strike. He's on 80 with 4 balls to go. Any chance of a 100?"
49.1,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run, no timing from the batsman. Went straight up but into a gap."
48.6,1,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run, keeps the strike for the last over"
48.5,4,"Cummins to Rahul, FOUR runs, attempted yorker, but Rahul moved back in his crease, and flicked it to fine leg for four. A diving Labuschagne can't prevent it"
48.4,6,"Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs, Cummins has tried to be too clever by half. This short ball Rahul was lying in wait for. Just opened the face of the bat and helped it away over third man all the way for six. Incredible shot."
48.3,0,"Cummins to Rahul, no run, full pace, shorter delivery. Rahul swings, but for once, doesn't connect"
48.2,2,"Cummins to Rahul, 2 runs, slower bouncer. Rahul turns his bat into a periscope and sort of tennis-smashes it to midwicket. Sharp running by the duo again, they have been superb"
48.1,1,"Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run, slower short delivery. Struck to extra cover. They still scamper through"
47.6,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run, full toss on leg stump. Very, very fortunate Jadeja's sent this right down to fine leg. That had four written all over it"
47.5,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run, helped down to the fine leg fielder"
47.4,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run, low full toss, thwacked to deep midwicket"
47.4,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 wide, dragged down. Big wide. So big KL Rahul toyed with the idea of coming through for a bye"
47.3,2,"Starc to Jadeja, 2 runs, full, reverse swinging yorker, but Jadeja smears it down to the onside and scampers back once more"
47.2,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run, run down to third man"
47.1,4,"Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs, backfoot punch, gorgeous shot again. What can you do about that? Bowling at 145, but Rahul still slices it away past third man for four"
46.6,2,"Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs, clever running once more. Chipped into the vacant space on the legside and Jadeja hares back for two more. 8 off that over"
46.5,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, runs it down to backward point"
46.4,1,"Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run, slower bouncer, nudged away to deep midwicket"
46.3,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, tonked down to cow corner. Rahul is timing the ball so sweetly right now"
46.2,1,"Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run, smashes it down the ground, runs well clear of the pitch this time"
46.1,2,"Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs, slower ball again. Jadeja works it away to the onside, and absolutely races back for two. He might have been running quicker than Richardson's bowling right now"
45.6,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run, sensibly keeps it short once more. But expensive over. Australia would have been counting on Starc, and his next two overs may be crucial to the game's outcome"
45.5,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run, short ball, helped away to the leg side"
45.5,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 wide, dragged down. This is a costly over, and 300 is up for India"
45.4,6,"Starc to Rahul, SIX runs, is that the shot of the day? I'd venture to say so. Starc at full tilt, and he's lifted him over extra cover for six as if he was Chris Harris on sedatives. Rahul has so much time right now"
45.3,4,"Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs, low full toss; this isn't good enough, but KL Rahul most certainly is. Pure timing which beats the man at deep cover-point, and he brings up his 50"
45.2,1,"Starc to Jadeja, 1 run, short delivery, looking to pepper Jadeja, I suspect. He gets off strike"
45.1,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run, crunched to cover-point. Beautiful timing on it"
44.6,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, smart running. Just timed to mid-off and he's on his way"
44.5,1,"Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run, carved to sweeper cover"
44.4,0,"Richardson to Jadeja, no run, guided to backward point. Thinks about a run, thinks again"
44.3,4,"Richardson to Jadeja, FOUR runs, four first delivery. You couldn't ask for a better one to be eased in. Down legside at pace, and all he needed to do was get a feather on it and watch it race away"
44.2,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, ungainly hoick that's nowhere near the middle. Jadeja on strike"
44.1,7,"Richardson to Pandey, OUT, top edged from Pandey, no timing on it and Agar completes a much easier catch this time. Was banged in short and Pandey went for the short arm jab, failing to find the middle of the bat"
43.6,1,"Zampa to Pandey, 1 run, this one darted through. Thick inside edge and he keeps the strike"
43.5,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, chipped to deep midwicket"
43.4,1,"Zampa to Pandey, 1 run, driven to long-off"
43.3,0,"Zampa to Pandey, no run, brave enough to give it more flight now. Defended to the covers"
43.2,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, paddled away to the leg side"
43.1,7,"Zampa to Kohli, OUT, he's gone! Zampa's got Kohli again! What a catch that is! Kohli lofted him straight back over his head, looked for all the world it would go for six but for some incredible work on the boundary. Agar takes a clean catch about six inches from the rope, feels himself going over and lobs the ball over to Starc. Incredible coordination for an incredibly big wicket"
42.6,1,"Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, slower ball, nudged into the offside. Good over from Australia at this stage"
42.5,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, sweetly timed to midwicket. Fielder does well to keep it to one"
42.4,2,"Richardson to Rahul, 2 runs, thumped over cover. No timing once more, but plenty of muscle on it"
42.3,0,"Richardson to Rahul, no run, nearly dragged it onto his stumps. Cannoned into his pads and Rahul frantically searched around for the ball to ensure it didn't trickle onto his stumps"
42.2,1,"Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, takes the pace off again. Cross-batted down the ground"
42.1,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, slower ball. No pace to work it, but Rahul smears it down to the sweeper for one"
41.6,2,"Agar to Kohli, 2 runs, dinked into the onside, and the lack of pace means the two can come back for a couple. Excellent batting by India. They appear to be scoring big runs without taking risks"
41.5,1,"Agar to Rahul, 1 run, crunches it down to long-on"
41.4,2,"Agar to Rahul, 2 runs, rocks back and carves it behind third man. 10 off the over already"
41.3,6,"Agar to Rahul, SIX runs, overpitches it, and pays the price! Full flighted ball, and there's no turn. Rahaul lofts it back over the bowler's head and it cannons into the sightscreen. Gorgeous shot"
41.2,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, good length from Agar. Not allowing Kohli to come down the track or rock back. Takes a single down long-on instead"
41.1,1,"Agar to Rahul, 1 run, nudged square on the leg side"
40.6,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, back down the ground and Rahul keeps the strike"
40.5,1,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, worked away for one"
40.4,4,"Zampa to Kohli, FOUR runs, cross-batted slog sweep - what a shot that is! Bottom hand sweep that Kohli somehow managed to keep along the ground without getting down on one knee, and pierces the gap between deep midwicket and long on"
40.3,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, another close call, but the batsman's inside edge gets him off strike"
40.2,0,"Zampa to Rahul, no run, stopped in the pitch a little, and nearly went through Rahul's bat-pad gap"
40.1,1,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, a bit of flight, flicked to wide long-on. Kohli's still in canter mode"
39.6,4,"Richardson to Rahul, FOUR runs, good length on middle, shuffles across to paddle pull fine behind square, super shot and beats the leg side sweeper to the rope."
39.5,1,"Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, fullish length on middle, flicked to deep midwicket."
39.4,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, good length on fourth stump, goes back to create room to cut to the sweeper."
39.3,1,"Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, good length on fifth stump, cut to the sweeper."
39.2,0,"Richardson to Kohli, no run, missed runout opportunity! Slower ball on off stump guided to Smith at backward point. Rahul took off from the non-striker's end, Smith tried to guide a throw back to Richardson over the stumps instead of firing for a direct hit. Too gentle and allowed Rahul time to get back. Throw was errant too high trying to lob it. Double-whammy."
39.1,1,"Richardson to Rahul, 1 run, full on the legs, flicked to deep square leg."
38.6,0,"Agar to Kohli, no run, flighted again on a full length on off stump at 81 kph, defended into the off side."
38.5,1,"Agar to Rahul, 1 run, good length but tighter on off stump, taps this through the covers."
38.4,4,"Agar to Rahul, FOUR runs, too short, too wide, too sweetly timed a cut shot by Rahul past backward point, cover sweeper is too wide to cut it off."
38.3,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, floated fuller and straying on the legs, gets the front leg out of the way to drive to long-on."
38.2,0,"Agar to Kohli, no run, good length but width on fifth stump, goes back to cut, beaten by extra bounce."
38.1,1,"Agar to Rahul, 1 run, good length ball on off, goes back to punch to the cover sweeper."
37.6,1,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run, short on fourth stump, knocked down just wide of the stumps for a sharp run."
37.5,0,"Cummins to Rahul, no run, short on the stumps, knocked down to backward point."
37.4,1,"Cummins to Kohli, 1 run, bouncer on the stumps, swatted down through midwicket."
37.3,0,"Cummins to Kohli, no run, good length ball on fifth stump, goes back to punch through cover but the ball keeps very low dribbling through to Carey."
37.2,0,"Cummins to Kohli, no run, good length ball on middle, defended to midwicket."
37.1,1,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run, short on the legs, tucked off the hips to deep fine leg."
36.6,2,"Agar to Kohli, 2 runs, flighted more on a good length with plenty of width outside off, guided behind point, sweeper has a lot of work to track down and they take two."
36.5,0,"Agar to Kohli, no run, quicker and fuller on middle stump, goes back to push down the pitch to Agar."
36.4,1,"Agar to Rahul, 1 run, fullish length on off stump, guided with an open face to the cover sweeper."
36.3,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, flatter on fourth stump on a good length, swatted along the ground to long-on."
36.2,1,"Agar to Rahul, 1 run, flighted much more on middle and off, tapped gently into the covers."
36.1,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, flighted full on fourth stump, pushed firmly to long-off."

35.4,0,"Cummins to Kohli, no run, good length ball on middle stump, taps this straight to midwicket."
35.3,0,"Cummins to Kohli, no run, good length ball on off stump, tries to tap and run, can't get it away."
35.2,4,"Cummins to Kohli, FOUR runs, hummana hummana! Same line and length, this time Kohli stays in his crease and drives it through extra cover."
35.1,4,"Cummins to Kohli, FOUR runs, yum yum yum! Fullish length on about fifth stump, but Kohli shuffles back and across to whip this through midwicket."
34.6,0,"Zampa to Rahul, no run, flighted full, defended back to Zampa."
34.5,1,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, very full on middle, toe-jammed out to long-on. Cursory bat raise to the dressing room and fans for his half-century at a run a ball. "
34.4,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, slightly short drifting into the legs, goes back to clip behind square."
34.3,1,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, full and wide, drives this along the ground to the sweeper."

33.5,4,"Starc to Kohli, FOUR runs, oof! What a shot! short on fifth stump, ball wasn't really coming onto the bat but Kohli's hands are so good, keeps them back long enough to still have power with the wrists to crack this past extra cover, no chance for the sweeper."
33.4,1,"Starc to Rahul, 1 run, short and wide, slapped off the back foot straight to the cover sweeper."
33.3,0,"Starc to Rahul, no run, short of a length on the hips, tries to tuck this into the leg side but can't get it away."
33.2,2,"Starc to Rahul, 2 runs, short outside off stump, guided past backward point and well wide of deep third man to allow a second."
33.1,4,"Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs, glorious! Fullish length ball angled across fourth stump, drives this firmly through extra cover. Races away and puts a charge into the crowd."
32.6,1,"Zampa to Rahul, 1 run, flatter and shorter on the stumps at 82 kph, goes back to flick behind square."
32.5,0,"Zampa to Rahul, no run, stretches forward to a full ball and pushes this tentatively short of extra cover."
32.4,7,"Zampa to Iyer, OUT, scratchy knock comes to an end with an ungainly hoick. Pressure was building ever so slightly on Shreyas, Zampa floats this one up on a fullish length on middle stump, the batsman goes for an impetuous flick heave across the line and misses badly. Middle stump knocked back. Not a shot you'd be putting in an Instagram story."
32.3,0,"Zampa to Iyer, no run, full on off, scuffs a drive back to Zampa."
32.2,0,"Zampa to Iyer, no run, full and wide, driven to backward point."
32.1,1,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, flighted full on off, driven hard back to Zampa at head height, oohs from the crowd as he spills it but it was a bump ball, misfield caroms wide of mid-off for a run."

31.1,2,"Starc to Kohli, 2 runs, full pitching outside leg, clipped behind square."
30.6,0,"Richardson to Iyer, no run, cutter at 122 kph on off stump, keeps the hands back to play it softly but can't glide it wide enough of backward point to make room for a run."
30.5,0,"Richardson to Iyer, no run, bouncer on the stumps this time at 133 kph, aborts a hook at lets it pass."
30.4,4,"Richardson to Iyer, FOUR runs, short outside off at 131 kph, sits up for him to tennis racquet swat it past midwicket in the ring through wide long-on."
30.3,0,"Richardson to Iyer, no run, bouncer on fifth stump, sways back to get under it with ease."
30.2,2,"Richardson to Iyer, 2 runs, full on off stump, driven hard through the covers, sweeper has to cover 20 yards before sliding at the rope so it's an easy two."
30.1,1,"Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, back of a length on off stump, guided to deep third man."
29.6,0,"Zampa to Iyer, no run, flight, and driven to extra cover. Just 2 off that Zampa over, and here's Peter to take you through the next 10"

29.3,0,"Zampa to Iyer, no run, blocked"

29.1,1,"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, crunched through the offside"
28.6,0,"Richardson to Iyer, no run, short of a length. 7 runs and a wicket from the 29th"
28.5,0,"Richardson to Iyer, no run, welcomes him to the crease with a bouncer. Iyer is an interesting move, though"
28.4,7,"Richardson to Dhawan, OUT, what just happened there! Dhawan has holed out for 96! It was under the armpit, the line Australia have targeted for so long. Dhawan used the pace, timed it perfectly, but saw it carry straight to the fielder at fine leg. Tremendous innings, but doesn't get him to three figures"
28.3,4,"Richardson to Dhawan, FOUR runs, the hundred partnership comes up! And how! Sees the slower ball early, rocks back,  waits for it, and deposits it back over Richardson's head for four"
28.2,1,"Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, slower ball, Kohli reads it early, and works it away to the on-side. Partnership is 99 now"
28.1,2,"Richardson to Kohli, 2 runs, backfoot punch through the covers. The sweeper on the boundary has a chase on, and keeps it to two"
27.6,4,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, FOUR runs, ruins the over for Australia. Just outside leg stump, and Dhawan helps it on with a cross batted thump. Beats fine leg. 6 from that one"
27.5,1,"Labuschagne to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli eases it back down to long-on. Very content to just hand Dhawan back the strike for now"
27.4,1,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, 1 run, another drag down, but Dhawan again only finds the boundary fielder"
27.3,0,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, no run, bit more flight. Slightly uppish on its way to midwciket"
27.2,0,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, no run, straight back to the bowler"
27.1,0,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, no run, smart bowling. Dhawan gave it away early by coming down the wicket, Labuschagne drags it down"
26.6,1,"Agar to Dhawan, 1 run, and Dhawan keeps the strike. 12 from this over. Are India finally moving up a gear?"
26.5,0,"Agar to Dhawan, no run, strikes him on the pad. Slight appeal from Agar"
26.4,4,"Agar to Dhawan, FOUR runs, and the poor ball comes. Down the onside, and Dhawan helps it to the fine leg boundary. This may well be Agar's last over"
26.3,6,"Agar to Dhawan, SIX runs, that's enormous. Dances down the track and absolutely thwacks this into the stand behind cow corner. The sweetness of the timing on that!"
26.2,0,"Agar to Dhawan, no run, runs down the ground, nearly yorks himself, though. Rare dot delivery"
26.1,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, opens the bat face to short third. Good running again"
25.6,0,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, no run, pushes Dhawan onto the back foot. Muffled appeal; the bowler seemed to believe it had brushed Dhawan's pad. Nothing doing, though"

25.4,1,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, 1 run, dragged down, fortunate Dhawan found the on side boundary rider instead of a gap"
25.3,1,"Labuschagne to Kohli, 1 run, eased to deep midwicket"
25.2,1,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, 1 run, uppish, nearly a caught-and-bowled. Chipped it over the bowler's head, no timing. Had Marnus been three inches taller, Dhawan would be gone"
25.1,4,"Labuschagne to Dhawan, FOUR runs, disdainfully sliced to the backward point boundary. Dhawan on fire isn't the best time to be asked to come on. Especially if you're a part-timer"
24.6,1,"Agar to Dhawan, 1 run, keeps the strike. 10 from the over"
24.5,4,"Agar to Dhawan, FOUR runs, and now the reverse sweep comes out! Helps it beat the third man fielder. Dhawan's moving up gears!"
24.4,4,"Agar to Dhawan, FOUR runs, lifts it over midwicket, exquisite sweep shot. Not much wrong with the delivery, really, but Dhawan's timing and placement is superb"
24.3,1,"Agar to Kohli, 1 run, more flight, slight turn, opens the face of the bat"
24.2,0,"Agar to Kohli, no run, and again, straight back to Agar"
24.1,0,"Agar to Kohli, no run, bit of air given to the ball, Kohli whacks it back to the bowler. On the bounce, mind you. Relax"
23.6,0,"Starc to Dhawan, no run, cramps him for room, Dhawan blocks"

21.2,1,"Starc to Dhawan, 1 run, and that's a half-century for Dhawan! Two in as many ODIs. His 29th half-century. The previous game will remind him he needs more than that"

And it's frankly a terrible review. He clearly lost his bearings falling off balance losing any sense of where he was in front of the stumps. Missed this full ball and was struck halfway up the shin. The ball was ripping out middle and off stump 3/4 of the way up. Shikhar should be equally at fault on the wasted review for not talking him out of it if he's got a good view at the non-striker's end."

8.6,1,"Richardson to Sharma, 1 run, and again. Rohit works it away to square leg and keeps the strike"

8.3,1,"Richardson to Sharma, 1 run, guided through the onside, and the pair change ends. The 50-partnership comes up"
8.2,4,"Richardson to Sharma, FOUR runs, this one beats the cover fielders though. Rocks back and crunches it through the offside. Cover point thought about giving it a chase, turned around and saw the ball racing away and stopped dead in his tracks."
8.1,0,"Richardson to Sharma, no run, back foot punch, straight to a fielder though"
7.6,4,"Cummins to Dhawan, FOUR runs, too easy fro Dhawan. Cummins goes down the legside again, and Dhawan just needs to flick it down to fine leg. The fielder isn't even at the boundary, but I suspect that might not have made a difference"

5.6,2,"Starc to Sharma, 2 runs, pulled away in front of midwicket. Absolutely no timing, but there's enough of a gap there for the batsmen to come back for two"
5.5,0,"Starc to Sharma, no run, cramps him for room"
5.4,2,"Starc to Sharma, 2 runs, works it past a diving backward point, who got a hand to it. It's technically a dropped catch, but blaming the fielder for it would be harsh in the extreme"
5.3,0,"Starc to Sharma, no run, driven to cover"
5.2,4,"Starc to Sharma, FOUR runs, gorgeous. Full on off stump, and Rohit leans into the drive, and the cover fielders don't even move. There would be no point."

5.1,0,"Starc to Sharma, no run, back of a length, driven back to the bowler"

4.1,0,"Cummins to Sharma, no run, oooh, Rohit misjudged the line there. Wanted to get on to the back foot to pull, ball goes underneath the bat"
3.6,0,"Starc to Dhawan, no run, defended"
3.5,4,"Starc to Dhawan, FOUR runs, well, that's just meat and drink for Dhawan. 146kph, full, dragged down the leg side. Dhawan needs only to use the pace and he sends it barrelling past fine leg for four."

2.3,0,"Cummins to Dhawan, no run, short of a length, leaves this one alone"
2.2,4,"Cummins to Dhawan, FOUR runs, a bit of width, and Dhawan latches on to it in a flash. Pinged past a diving cover-point fielder all the way. When you give Dhawan a chance to free his arms, you'd best be prepared for what follows"

1.6,1,"Starc to Dhawan, 1 run, runs it down to fine leg. Five from Starc's first over"

45.5,7,"Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT, he's gone through him! Full ball, and Kohli shuffles across and tries a swipe towards mid-wicket. Misses out on contact, and the ball just kisses the pads and then smashes into the stumps. Chinnaswamy rises as one to applaud this innings.

1.2,0,"Starc to Sharma, no run, shorter, wider, and he leaves"
1.2,1,"Starc to Sharma, 1 wide, fuller, but down the leg side"
1.1,0,"Starc to Sharma, no run, length, just outside off, and he leaves"
0.6,1,"Cummins to Sharma, 1 run, length, a bit of nip away, and he runs this off the outer part of the bat down to third man. Along the ground, so risk-free in that sense"
0.5,0,"Cummins to Sharma, no run, length, outside off, and he shoulders arms to this"
0.4,0,"Cummins to Sharma, no run, length, and he presses forward to defend one around off stump"

49.6,1,"Mohammed Shami to Agar, 1 run, superb from Shami. Finishes with another yorker, and Australia can only manage to get one off the final delivery. Superb final 10 overs from India. Only 63 runs conceded, and India need 287 to win the game, and the series."
49.5,1,"Mohammed Shami to Hazlewood, 1 run, gets off the mark with a run down to mid-off"

49.2,7,"Mohammed Shami to Zampa, OUT, cleans up Zampa! Shami just keeps picking up wickets. Inswinging full ball, Zampa tries to go big, it comes off his pad and smashes into leg stump"
49.1,1,"Mohammed Shami to Agar, 1 run, low full toss, helped along to deep midwicket from Agar, but no more than one"

48.3,1,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 run, gets a single through the offside"
48.2,1,"Bumrah to Zampa, 1 leg bye, dragged down legside, and Rahul fails to gather it. Lucky fine leg clears up, so it's just 1 run instead of 4"
48.1,1,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye, into the pads, and Agar comes through for a leg bye. Can Bumrah clean up this innings here and now?"
47.6,0,"Mohammed Shami to Zampa, no run, driven back. Splendid over. 3 runs and 2 wickets."
47.5,0,"Mohammed Shami to Zampa, no run, Zampa tamely drives it through the covers. Surprised Shami didn't go for the yorker again"
47.4,7,"Mohammed Shami to Cummins, OUT, and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball."
47.3,1,"Mohammed Shami to Agar, 1 run, inswinging yorker, that's the ball he needs to bowl as much of as possible. Agar can do little but run it off the face and take the single"
47.2,2,"Mohammed Shami to Agar, 2 runs, guided through the on-side field, and comes back for two. He needs to play a big part here"
47.1,7,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, OUT, Smith holes out to deep midwicket! Tried to play a similar shot to that flick that went for six a couple of overs ago and Iyer completes a brilliant catch charging in and diving forward. Big wicket, that, could lop about 20-25 runs off the score, potentially."
46.6,1,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run, placed it around cow corner. Realised too late he could have had two. Settles for the one. Still, a dozen off that over"

46.4,1,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run, opens the face and runs it down to the sweeper. 10 off four balls"
46.3,4,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs, two in a row. Bumrah finally copping some punishment at Smiths hands. Another slower delivery well outside off stump. Poor delivery in truth, and Smith is too hot right now to miss out on that"
46.2,4,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs, Smith wins the ball for now. Saw third man was inside the circle, and deliberately edges the ball fine of him to get the boundary. This is world-class batting against tough bowling"
46.1,1,"Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye, smacks Agar on the pad, and he runs through for the leg-bye. Right, Smith and Bumrah. What a contest"
45.6,2,"Saini to Smith, 2 runs, worked away to cow corner, and placed it nicely enough he was able to come back for 2. 16 off the over. Australia need at least a couple more like that"
45.5,1,"Saini to Agar, 1 run, finally nails the yorker. Agar digs it out and gets Smith back on strike for the final ball of the over"
45.4,1,"Saini to Smith, 1 run, gets a single to the offside. 13 off the first four. Can Agar support Smith here in making this a gigantic over?"
45.3,6,"Saini to Smith, SIX runs, what an absolutely nonsensical shot that is. Absolutely ridiculous. Just outside off, and SMith moves across, and simply wrists it in the air over deep square leg. Sails away for six. That was all wrist."
45.2,2,"Saini to Smith, 2 runs, runs this to the right of third man and calls 'two' straightaway. Good start from Australia, can they make this a big over?"

44.1,2,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 2 runs, driven back past the bowler and a dive from Chahal prevents it from crossing the boundary"
43.6,7,"Saini to Turner, OUT, marvellous delivery to finish. Yorker just outside off stump, goes underneath the bat. India re stifling Australia here. And what's this? India have reviewed for a caught behind! The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli; the wicket came from nowhere"
43.5,1,"Saini to Smith, 1 run, nice timing, and what's happened now?  Smith ran through for a single, and Ashton Turner wasn't even looking at him. A throw at the keeper's end would have produced a wicket"
43.4,1,"Saini to Turner, 1 run, yorker, they scurry through for one. The throw hits Smith as he lunges to get back into the crease"
43.3,1,"Saini to Smith, 1 run, there it is. Runs it down to third man and brings up his ninth ODI hundred, and third against India. It's been a commanding knock. Not much of a celebration. Knows there's more work to be done"
43.2,0,"Saini to Smith, no run, drives smartly to backward point, who collects sharply. Turner wanted the run, but Smith is taking no chances"
43.1,1,"Saini to Turner, 1 run, quick single, was desperate to get Smith back on strike. And now, hwre's Smith on 99"
42.6,1,"Bumrah to Turner, 1 run, runs it down to the deep cover fielder. Turner keeps the strike again. Smith will have to wait a while longer!"
42.5,0,"Bumrah to Turner, no run, five in a row. Almost squared him up. Can Bumrah actually bowl a maiden over here?"
42.4,0,"Bumrah to Turner, no run, back of a length, pushed to the covers. No run in this over so far"
42.3,0,"Bumrah to Turner, no run, and again. This man produces on demand. He bowls yorkers with more consistency than I make a good cup of tea. And that's a real compliment"
42.2,0,"Bumrah to Turner, no run, wonderful bowling. Perfect yorker, and all Turner can do is not let the ball go under his bat"
42.1,0,"Bumrah to Turner, no run, beaten by the ball keeping low. Thick under-edge"
41.6,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Turner, 1 run, helped down to third man. Turner keeps the strike"
41.5,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 1 run, drives to long-on, and moves to 99."
41.4,7,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, OUT, played with the turn, and the wicket finally comes!. Lofted it over cover, and looked a pretty good shot, in all fairness. But because he was reaching for it outside off stump, he never could get the purchase he needed to clear the ropes. Big wicket for Kuldeep in his final over"
41.3,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 1 run, cut away, produces only a single"
41.2,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 1 run, drops it short, lucky Carey only finds the sweeper with a crunch through the covers"

40.5,0,"Mohammed Shami to Carey, no run, shows Shami the stumps again. Backed away, but couldn't quite find a productive shot to go with it"
40.4,4,"Mohammed Shami to Carey, FOUR runs, clever cricket. Clears the front leg, moves away to give himself room and crunches it through the offside. Races away to the boundary"
40.3,0,"Mohammed Shami to Carey, no run, good delivery, seams back in to Carey, who simply played down the wrong line and found his inside edge beaten"
40.2,0,"Mohammed Shami to Carey, no run, tried to run it down to third man, can't quite beat the backward point fielder"
40.1,1,"Mohammed Shami to Smith, 1 run, touched away to square leg"
39.6,4,"Bumrah to Carey, FOUR runs, short, and he looks to drive this. Off the outside edge, and third man fails to reel it in. Off Saini's hands and touches the fence."
39.5,0,"Bumrah to Carey, no run, looks for the yorker, but overcooks it. Carey drives, but cannot beat mid-on"

37.6,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 1 run, loops one outside off in the air, in going for the slog sweep! Got absolutely no timing on it, and it lands limply around the mid-wicket region, with no fielder in the immediate vicinity. Lucky Carey on this occasion"
37.5,2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 2 runs, length, around off, and he sweeps this towards deep backward square leg. A fielder sweeping at the deep mid-wicket fence gets around to his left to save two for his team"
37.4,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 1 run, length, and he skips down the wicket to hit this hard towards long-on. Bowled at 78.4kph"

35.6,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 1 run, sweeps from outside off towards long leg to retain strike"
35.5,4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, FOUR runs, that's a good shot! This is closer to him, and he whips this through mid-wicket. It went on with the angle from over the wicket, and he flogged it over the man at the short mid-wicket fence"
35.4,1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, 1 run, wrong 'un again, and he shuffles across to fetch it from outside off towards long leg"
35.3,0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, no run, wrong 'un, zips past the outside edge. Smith doesn't pick this off the hands"

33.6,0,"Jadeja to Carey, no run, looks for the reverse sweep again. Misses on contact, with a ball fired outside off (effectively leg). Jadeja wants a caught-behind in his favour. Not given, and India also refuse to refer this"

31.6,7,"Jadeja to Starc, OUT, two wickets in the over, but a not-so-huge loss for Australia! Jadeja pulls the length back a touch, and also slows it down. Starc looks to slog across the line, but gets it quite high on the bad, and substitute Chahal down by the deep mid-wicket fence has to move across to his left to accept this gleefully!"
31.5,0,"Jadeja to Starc, no run, slogs across the line. Inside edge towards fine leg"

31.3,7,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT, what a grab this time! Jadeja has tossed this up a touch, and Labuschagne plays another whippy inside out drive. Cannot keep it down, and Kohli dives low to his right and plucks this inches off the grass. Makes it look effortless, but that was a fabulous effort! Big wicket, but it might not be the worst thing for Australia to have some fresh legs and some big hitting out in the middle now"
31.2,0,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run, length, driven towards cover, where Kohli fields"

25.6,0,"Jadeja to Smith, no run, defended"

23.2,0,"Jadeja to Smith, no run, defended to extra cover"

31.1,7,"de Grandhomme to Thakur, OUT, ...and de Grandhomme nips one through the gate of Thakur. Knocks back the off stump. Good length, swerves back in from outside off, Thakur drives from the crease, and is beaten on the inside edge. NZ three away from wrapping up the series"

30.3,1,"Neesham to Jadeja, 1 run, much fuller and outside off, patted to the right of mid-off, de Grandhomme swoops down on the ball, but can't hit the stumps. Even if he had hit, Jadeja would have been home. Just too quick"

28.5,0,"Neesham to Thakur, no run, awkwardly blocks a fuller delivery that straightens on him and Neesham fields it off his own bowling and attempts to run the batsman out. Thakur is outside his crease, but he;s in the way of the throw, not deliberately of course."

27.4,0,"Bennett to Thakur, no run, defends a fuller delivery on off stump"
27.3,7,"Bennett to Iyer, OUT, caught behind! Iyer's gone! Are India gone as well? It's strange to see Iyer play such a manufactured shot. He's clearing his front leg looking to cut a ball right off the top of middle stump. And as good as he is on the cut shot, this is just not on. It's not short enough. He doesn't have the room. Ends up getting a healthy nick through to the keeper"
27.2,4,"Bennett to Iyer, FOUR runs, very very deft to bring up another impressive fifty! The ball is only a shade outside off, but he knows if he can get it fine enough, he'll have an easy boundary to third man. Outstanding clarity under pressure"
27.1,0,"Bennett to Iyer, no run, defends a fuller ball on off stump. Iyer looks absolutely unruffled out there. This tour has been his making"

26.4,5,"Neesham to Jadeja, 5 wides, the bouncer strays way too high and doesn't even come down for the keeper to have a chance"
26.3,2,"Neesham to Jadeja, 2 leg byes, lovely running. He doesn't even hit the ball, going off the pad as he tries to flick, but since it goes off the pad and into the vacant square leg region, he knows contact is soft and he can push for the second before the keeper can get to it"
26.2,4,"Neesham to Jadeja, FOUR runs, inside edge! Jadeja still benefits from a slight misjudgment, driving at a ball that nips back into him off the pitch. Goes through the gap between bat and pad, just about missing the stumps"
26.1,1,"Neesham to Iyer, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, guides it down to deep third man"
25.6,0,"Bennett to Jadeja, no run, rises up off his toes to knock the shortish ball down the pitch"

25.4,0,"Bennett to Iyer, no run, opens the face to try and guide the length ball to third man, no luck"
25.3,1,"Bennett to Jadeja, 1 run, risky single, but Jadeja is seriously quick and he commits to the single to mid-off immediately. Jamieson is a touch slow to get to the ball and that gives enough time for the run to be taken"

25.1,0,"Bennett to Iyer, no run, steers it to backward point"
24.6,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, defends a good length ball to point and that's the end of a very brave effort from Tim Southee. It's said he's ill and he wasn't even set to play this game. And now as he walks back, every single one of his team-mates running up to him and patting him on the back. Latham, the captain, Taylor, Guptill, Neesham, Chapman, Jamieson... and finally off he disappears behind the sightscreen for some well deserved rest"
24.5,4,"Southee to Jadeja, FOUR runs, cracks it away over the slips. A tiny bit short and wide from the bowler which allows Jadeja to throw his bat"
24.4,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, beaten after stepping down the track, his frustrations clear. Jadeja is primed. He doesn't like these dot balls. He's feeling the pressure and he nearly buckles to it as Southee keeps hitting away in the corridor outside off"
24.3,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, full and outside off, tempting the drive on the up, Jadeja isn't interested"

23.2,0,"Bennett to Jadeja, no run, full and outside off, pushes to cover"
23.1,1,"Bennett to Iyer, 1 run, would have been run-out but Guptill, having leapt to his left, full stretch to grab the ball, is completely off balance as he flicks a throw to the strikers end. Iyer thought he'd got the gap after playing the cut shot, but nope... Jadeja didn't want the run. He had his hand up saying no, but then seeing Iyer not stopping, he eventually had to commit"
22.6,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, full and outside off, steers it to cover"
22.5,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, ripper! He definitely looks red in the face, the effort this is taking out of him quite visible. Actually grimaces after hitting the deck and making the ball move past Jadeja's defensive bat"

22.3,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, shortish on off stump, he pulls down the ground"

21.3,4,"de Grandhomme to Iyer, FOUR runs, that is unreal! No, actually, it's been done millions of times before here, by Martin Guptill, who takes length balls for a ride over mid-on better than virtually anyone else at this ground. Well now he's got competition"
21.2,0,"de Grandhomme to Iyer, no run, good length, outside off, no shot"
21.1,0,"de Grandhomme to Iyer, no run, full and outside off, blocks"
20.6,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, is almost drawn into poking at a back of a length ball that nips away from him"
20.5,7,"Southee to Jadhav, OUT, pops it to cover! The move to bring back Southee works! The pressure NZ have been putting shows. And Jadhav, having looked capable enough to block the good ones and hit the bad ones, goes after the wrong ball - not quite a half-volley to be playing such booming drives - and presents a simple catch. Cross eamer from Southee, which explains the ball hitting higher up on the bat"
20.4,0,"Southee to Jadhav, no run, keeps the bat face straight to deal with a full ball on off stump"
20.3,0,"Southee to Jadhav, no run, nudges a full ball on off stump to midwicket"

20.1,0,"Southee to Jadhav, no run, kicks up off the pitch, but Jadhav deals with it well enough, dabbing to backward point"
19.6,6,"de Grandhomme to Iyer, SIX runs, shoooooooot! He really is so good at hitting down the ground! Makes a little room to the leg side so he has a free swing and then basically bullies a perfectly good length ball over the long-off boundary."
19.5,0,"de Grandhomme to Iyer, no run, slips under the bouncer - yep, CdG bowls them too"
19.4,1,"de Grandhomme to Jadhav, 1 run, very sensible work from Jadhav, allowing the back of a length ball to come to him and dinking it into vacant square leg"

17.4,0,"de Grandhomme to Jadhav, no run, good length outside off, blocks"
17.3,4,"de Grandhomme to Jadhav, FOUR runs, clubs it down the ground. It's floated up very wide outside off and Jadhav drags it, finding a gap to the left of mid-on."
17.2,0,"de Grandhomme to Jadhav, no run, fullish on off stump, defends"
17.1,1,"de Grandhomme to Iyer, 1 run, inside edge as he goes for a big booming cover drive, but de Grandhomme gets the ball to wobble just enough into the right-hander and the ball goes to deep fine leg"

14.5,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, bouncer which Iyer avoids quite easily"
14.4,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, good length on middle, defends"
14.3,4,"Jamieson to Iyer, FOUR runs, walks across his crease, then nips back outside leg stump, and all that messing about yields results. Jamieson is scrambled off his usual good length top of off bowling to offer a short and wide delivery that Iyer cuts to the fence"

14.1,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, opens the face to steer a good length ball to point"

13.3,0,"de Grandhomme to Jadhav, no run, full on middle, defends"
13.2,7,"de Grandhomme to Rahul, OUT, wrong ball to cut! There is zero room available. It's not even that short. But Rahul really is in such glorious form and sometimes players in that zone manufacture shots. Here he takes it a touch too far, getting only an inside edge back onto the stumps"
13.1,0,"de Grandhomme to Rahul, no run, covers the line of a gentle outswinger and steers it to point"
12.6,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, ends with another short ball which, again, Iyer doesn't bother with"
12.5,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, tiiiiight leave. It's another bouncer from Jamieson, this one constantly coming into the right-hander. Iyer though drops his wrists and sways away very athletically to avoid being hit"
12.4,1,"Jamieson to Rahul, 1 run, plays close to the body, which allows him to work a short ball on leg stump through midwicket"
12.3,0,"Jamieson to Rahul, no run, solidly behind the fuller ball on off stump"
12.2,0,"Jamieson to Rahul, no run, evades the bouncer angled into him"

11.6,1,"Southee to Iyer, 1 run, lovely drive, leaning into the shot to minimise the risk of playing on the up. Well controlled for a single through cover"
11.5,0,"Southee to Iyer, no run, defends a good length ball on off stump"
11.4,4,"Southee to Iyer, FOUR runs, drills it down the ground! A touch too full and perfectly primed for the drive and Iyer does not hold back. Outstanding shot. The confidence he has to wait for balls in his area sets him apart from other rookie Indian batsmen"
11.3,0,"Southee to Iyer, no run, appeal from the bowler for caught behind. He wants something for this jaffa, and it really is a jaffa. Goes wide of the crease for a length ball that pitches in line with the stumps, makes the batsman play, and beats the outside edge"
11.2,0,"Southee to Iyer, no run, defends the inswinging ball in line with the stumps"
11.1,1,"Southee to Rahul, 1 run, turns a fuller delivery at the stumps down to fine leg"

10.4,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, good length on middle and leg, keeps it out"
10.3,4,"Jamieson to Iyer, FOUR runs, gloooooorious shot!. Nothing tentative about this as Iyer pitches up the fuller ball and extends the arms, a lofted drive over mid-off with all the class he possesses"
10.2,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, a very cautious block, Iyer wary of the pitched up ball straightening to take his edge. Jamieson's control has been very impressive. And for a guy over 2m tall, his ability to consistently attack the stumps is also really cool"
10.1,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, full on off stump, he taps it back to the bowler"
9.6,0,"Southee to Rahul, no run, inducker from Southee, inside-edged onto the pad"

9.4,7,"Southee to Kohli, OUT, now, it's Southee's turn to breach the defences of Kohli. Southee goes wide of the crease and brings this full ball back into Kohli after having tested the captain with a surfeit of awayswingers. The batsman is opened up and falls over the flick. Hits the middle and leg stumps. Just like that NZ's 273 for 8 looks a whole lot bigger now"
9.3,1,"Southee to Iyer, 1 run, on the hips, tucked around the corner for one"
9.2,1,"Southee to Kohli, 1 run, even fuller and outside off, driven down the ground"
9.1,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, on a length and nipping in as Kohli falls over the flick. Kohli has inside-edged it onto the pad, so Latham decides against a review. Height was also an issue. Replays suggest there was no bat involved, ricocheted onto back pad off the front pad. The tracker returns umpire's call on middle"
8.6,1,"Jamieson to Kohli, 1 run, on a length and outside off, thickly edged to deep third man"
8.5,4,"Jamieson to Kohli, FOUR runs, dug in short and outside off, Kohli swivels back and crunches another one. Pulled up and over midwicket for his first boundary"

7.5,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, on a length and outside off, driven on the up to extra-cover, where Nicholls makes a fine save"
7.4,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, wide of the crease once again, Southee gets this length ball to hold its line outside off. Kohli presses forward to get closer to the pitch and guide it to point"
7.4,1,"Southee to Kohli, 1 wide, wide of the crease and swings away so sharply that it has been called an off-side wide"
7.3,2,"Southee to Kohli, 2 runs, Kohli shimmies down the track, then shimmies across to work a single into the leg side"

6.2,0,"Jamieson to Kohli, no run, on a length and outside off, Kohli checks his drive and chips it to the left of Jamieson. Jamieson sticks out his left hand in his followthrough but the ball doesn't stick. Will go down as a dropped chance"
6.1,0,"Jamieson to Kohli, no run, pitched up and slanting in at off, forward and driven to mid-on"
5.6,4,"Southee to Iyer, FOUR runs, Iyer threads the cordon. Rides another short ball outside off and dabs it between slips and gully for four"

5.4,0,"Southee to Iyer, no run, full and Southee brings this back to threaten off from wide of the crease, pushed back to him"
5.3,4,"Southee to Iyer, FOUR runs, on a length and swings outside off, not a half-volley, but Iyer takes it on and crunches a drive through cover. That's how good Iyer is. First-ball four"
5.2,1,"Southee to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli slices an attempted cover drive and the ball streaks away to backward point"
5.1,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, good length, angling in and bending away extravagantly outside off, Kohli chases and is beaten lavishly"
4.6,7,"Jamieson to Shaw, OUT, Jamieson storms through the defences of Shaw. Lands it on the seam and bowls the opener through the gate. What a way to get your first wicket - at your home ground. Good length, Jamieson brings this one back sharply and makes Shaw's attempted drive look a whole lot worse. Timbaaah and NZ are into India's middle order already. Shaw: six fours and out"
4.5,0,"Jamieson to Shaw, no run, on a length and just a shade outside off, punched on the up but Shaw can't get it past short cover"

3.4,0,"Southee to Shaw, no run, wide of the crease, short and holds its line outside off, forced to point"
3.3,4,"Southee to Shaw, FOUR runs, Shaw continues to deal in fours. On a length and outside off, cracked on the up through the covers. He stays leg-side of the ball and flays it away"
3.2,1,"Southee to Kohli, 1 run, on a length and on fifth-stump line, this comes back with the angle from over the wicket. Kohli drives a long way away from his body and inside-edges it away past leg stump"

2.6,4,"Bennett to Shaw, FOUR runs, back of a length and outside off, 139ks, Shaw clunks it over mid-on inside the circle. Not middled, but the ball rolls away to the fence"
2.5,0,"Bennett to Shaw, no run, shortish and around off, Shaw is in two minds: where to play or not. He does a bit of both and fends it to cover"
2.4,3,"Bennett to Kohli, 3 runs, on a length on off, Kohli gets inside the line and flicks with the angle behind square to get off the mark"
2.3,7,"Bennett to Agarwal, OUT, nicked off to slip. Taylor in the thick of the action once again. In-between length from Bennett - he is in the side to hit that length. Angling in from over the wicket and straightens away outside off. Agarwal is caught on the crease. He is opened up, edging it to Taylor"
2.2,2,"Bennett to Agarwal, 2 runs, back of a length and outside off, lovely back-foot punch from Agarwal, finds the gap between covers and point. Agarwal thinks he has got four. Then realises the ball plugs in the outfield, and comes back for the second"
2.2,1,"Bennett to Agarwal, 1 wide, bumper outside off, soars into the gloves of Latham. Too high, so that's a wide"
2.1,0,"Bennett to Agarwal, no run, much better from Bennett. He hits that hard length and gets it to shape away from an off-stump line. Agarwal loosens his grip and defends off the back foot"
2.1,1,"Bennett to Agarwal, 1 wide, back of a length and slanted down leg. Bennett is spraying the ball all around the shop. He needs to tighten up"
1.6,4,"Southee to Shaw, FOUR runs, short and swinging away wide of off, Shaw relishes width. He thumps a cut in the air over backward point"

0.2,4,"Bennett to Shaw, FOUR runs, full-toss, heading down the leg side, tickled away to the fine-leg fence. Easy peace"
0.1,4,"Bennett to Shaw, FOUR runs, fumbled for four. Blundell messes up at mid-off. Pitched up and outside off, solidly driven straight of mid-off. He dives over the ball and leaks four"

49.2,4,"Bumrah to Taylor, FOUR runs, wow, off the back of the bat. Back of a length and outside off, Taylor uses the pace of Bumrah, reverses it fine of short third man. Not middled, but very funky from Taylor"
49.1,1,"Bumrah to Jamieson, 1 run, full and outside off, Bumrah doesn't quite nail the yorker, driven down to long-on for one"
48.6,0,"Saini to Taylor, no run, Saini nails the wide yorker, squeezes under Taylor's swinging bat"
48.5,1,"Saini to Jamieson, 1 run, dug in short on middle, cramps big Jamieson for room. Flapped through the leg side and over to Taylor"
48.4,1,"Saini to Taylor, 1 run, full-toss just a shade outside off, lifted to long-on. Strong throw from Jadeja, keeps Taylor to just a single"
48.3,2,"Saini to Taylor, 2 runs, pitched up and outside off, scythed away fine of Shaw at deep third man. Taylor scampers across for the second. The ball gets stuck in Rahul's gloves and he can't disturb the stumps"

46.6,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 run, Taylor indeed was looking to hit over midwicket, but does not get hold of it. Possibly a slower ball from Thakur. Taylor slogs across the line and skies it. It drops down, Iyer runs across, dives, but the ball eludes his grasp"
46.6,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 wide, knuckle ball from Thakur, tight, Taylor jumps across off. Umpire Oxeford deems it an off-side wide again. Thakur and Kohli are peeved"
46.6,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 wide, Thakur searches for that wide yorker and pushes it past the tramline for an off-side wide"
46.5,1,"Thakur to Jamieson, 1 run, full-toss outside off, sliced to the right of sweeper"

45.5,0,"Bumrah to Jamieson, no run, inswinging yorker, dug out to short midwicket"
45.4,4,"Bumrah to Jamieson, 4 byes, bumper, flies from wide of the crease, flies over Rahul's head for 4 byes. Jamieson had ducked out of the way. Bumrah has a wry smile"
45.3,0,"Bumrah to Jamieson, no run, banged in short and bounces outside off, gets big even on the 6 ft 8 in Jamieson. Beaten"

43.1,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, pushed through on middle, defended back to the right of Chahal"
42.6,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 run, Bumrah runs around the ball instead of running in. He dives belatedly and only takes the ball on the bounce. Much fuller and wide outside off, Taylor throws his bat at the ball. Slashes in the air and gets away"

41.5,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, looped up on off, run away towards point"
41.4,4,"Chahal to Taylor, FOUR runs, shortish legbreak from Chahal. Turns and bounces, Taylor cuts it away fine of short third man for four"
41.3,7,"Chahal to Southee, OUT, taken at long-on. Chahal dangles it up outside off and gets it to break away further. Southee can't show enough restraint. He has a crack at it and ends up awkwardly dragging the ball straight into the lap of Saini"
41.2,0,"Chahal to Southee, no run, flatter on leg stump, jammed out"
41.1,1,"Chahal to Taylor, 1 run, googly on off, worked to the midwicket region. Taylor exposes Southee to Chahal early in the over"

39.4,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, googly? Nurdled defensively to midwicket"
39.3,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, flighted and outside off, slices a drive to the left of extra-cover. Agarwal makes a sprawling save. Taylor strays out, Southee sends him back. He pulls out a big dive and saves himself"

39.1,1,"Chahal to Southee, 1 run, back of a length and breaks away outside off, slapped to deep point"
38.6,1,"Bumrah to Southee, 1 run, short on off, fended behind point.They take on Jadeja's arm. For a change, he misses the stumps at the non-striker's end, and Southee survives"

37.4,7,"Chahal to Chapman, OUT, Chapman offers up a simple return catch. He missed out earlier in the afternoon, but hangs onto this one. On a length, starts outside off and breaks back in, holds up in the pitch. Chapman is early into a back-foot drive and ends up spooning it back to Chahal. NZ collapse around Taylor"
37.3,1,"Chahal to Taylor, 1 run, "
37.2,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, looped up on off, Taylor stretches out and plays it back to the bowler"
37.1,1,"Chahal to Chapman, 1 run, tossed on middle, driven neatly wide of short midwicket"
36.6,7,"Thakur to de Grandhomme, OUT, De Grandhomme holes out, leaving NZ six down. Another case of bad shot selection or rather bad execution. Hip-high short ball, angling into off stump, de Grandhomme aims to pick it up and whip it over deep square leg. Instead, he splices it to Iyer there"
36.5,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 run, back of a length and angling into middle, dropped into the vacant spaces at square leg"
36.4,4,"Thakur to Taylor, FOUR runs, on a length and angling in, hockey-swiped away with the angle to the midwicket boundary, beating a diving Iyer in the outfield"

36.2,0,"Thakur to Taylor, no run, back of a length, jumps from that length and beats Taylor's attempted cut. Too close to off for a cut perhaps"
36.1,0,"Thakur to Taylor, no run, back of a length and slanting in at off, Taylor goes back and across in defence"
35.6,0,"Jadeja to de Grandhomme, no run, pushed through outside off, driven with a slicing finish to cover-point. End of a fine spell from Jadeja"

34.3,1,"Saini to de Grandhomme, 1 run, full-toss on middle, punched to the right of mid-on"
34.2,7,"Saini to Taylor, OUT, Jadeja (who else?) nails the stumps. Neesham has been caught well short by a rocket direct-hit. Just short of a good length and around off, Taylor dinks it away behind point and takes off for a run. Jadeja swoops down to his natural side - left - gathers the ball with just one hand and demolishes the stumps like only he can. Another run-out has set NZ back and Jadeja makes it look ridiculously easy"
34.1,1,"Saini to Neesham, 1 run, back of a length and on off stump, angled down to deep third man"
33.6,1,"Jadeja to Neesham, 1 run, whipped from outside off through the vacant spaces at midwicket"

33.2,1,"Jadeja to Neesham, 1 run, tossed outside off, worked away to deep midwicket"
33.1,7,"Jadeja to Latham, OUT, gives him lbw but Latham reviews. Jadeja is around the wicket to the left-hander, hitting a good length and pinning Latham on off stump. But with this angle, it might well have missed off stump. Unless it turns enough. Latham is playing the sweep - it's his go-to shot, only this time he doesn't connect and now has to wait for a few and poof he has to walk off. Ball-tracking says that ball did indeed turn enough to crash into off stump"
32.6,1,"Bumrah to Latham, 1 run, opens the face and sends the short ball to deep third man"
32.5,1,"Bumrah to Taylor, 1 run, goes short and at the body, Taylor pulls to deep square leg"
32.4,1,"Bumrah to Latham, 1 run, three slower balls on the trot and Latham is ready for this one too, calmly dinking it to fine leg"

32.2,0,"Bumrah to Latham, no run, slower ball on leg stump, Latham pushes towards mid-on"
32.1,1,"Bumrah to Taylor, 1 run, steers a shortish delivery outside off to third man"
31.6,1,"Jadeja to Taylor, 1 leg bye, huuuuuge appeal for lbw from Jadeja as he pins Taylor on the back foot. The batsman is playing across the line and the ball having hit a good length does skid on, but it probably would have gone down leg as well"
31.5,1,"Jadeja to Latham, 1 run, full on leg stump, whips to deep square leg"
31.4,0,"Jadeja to Latham, no run, premeditates the lap sweep, allowing Jadeja to spear it well outside off. Nearly traps him with that change in line as the ball almost carries to short fine leg"
31.3,1,"Jadeja to Taylor, 1 run, quicker and flatter outside off, dabs it to the right of short third man"
31.2,1,"Jadeja to Latham, 1 leg bye, steps down the wicket to flick a ball on leg stump through midwicket, but doesn't get any bat on it."
31.1,0,"Jadeja to Latham, no run, keeps the front leg away to try and whip the short ball through midwicket. Too cramped to do so"
30.6,1,"Bumrah to Latham, 1 run, taps a shortish ball outside off to deep third man"
30.5,2,"Bumrah to Latham, 2 runs, excellent timing as Latham whips a fuller delivery on off stump straight of midwicket"

29.3,0,"Jadeja to Latham, no run, again, starts off slow and full to the new batsman. Defends"
29.2,7,"Jadeja to Taylor, OUT, Guptill run-out!. Ooooh, there is never a single there, but Taylor has his mind set on it having played a reverse sweep off the back of the bat. There is no real hesitation in the running, just that Thakur is very alert there and flings in a flat throw right over the top of the stumps. So basically, the fielder does everything right and gets a wicket, the batsmen do one thing wrong and they lose a wicket"
29.1,0,"Jadeja to Taylor, no run, eases the full ball on the stumps to short cover"
28.6,4,"Thakur to Guptill, FOUR runs, nails the pull! The gap is behind square leg so Guptill rolls his wrists and concentrates solely on placement. Excellent cricket"
28.5,0,"Thakur to Guptill, no run, full on middle, he defends to mid-on"

28.2,0,"Thakur to Taylor, no run, full on middle, drives to mid-on"
28.1,2,"Thakur to Taylor, 2 runs, giving width to Taylor is a big no-no. He absolutely whacks it over point"
27.6,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, good length, sliding on with the arm. Guptill plays for spin and gets hit on the pad. Would be going down leg this time"
27.5,1,"Jadeja to Taylor, 1 run, waits on the back foot and tucks it behind square leg"
27.4,4,"Jadeja to Taylor, FOUR runs, lovely cricket! Taylor knows he only needs to get the littlest bat on it with Jadeja firing them in on leg stump. The picture perfect leg glance"
27.3,1,"Jadeja to Guptill, 1 run, slides down leg as he goes quick at the set batsman. Guptill finds a single to deep square leg"
27.2,1,"Jadeja to Taylor, 1 run, good length on middle, turns it towards square leg"
27.1,0,"Jadeja to Taylor, no run, nice and slow on off stump to the new batsman, Taylor defends to cover"
26.6,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 run, waits on the fuller ball quite nicely and turns it from off stump through square leg"
26.5,0,"Thakur to Taylor, no run, inside edge this time as he tries to drive a length ball outside off on the up through the covers"
26.4,0,"Thakur to Taylor, no run, outside edge first up as he defends a good length ball outside off"
26.3,7,"Thakur to Blundell, OUT, taken at mid-on! An innings full of promise, undone by poor shot selection. He had pressure on the bowler. He was trying to put more on him by taking a length ball outside off and slogging it away. Only, he mis-hits it to the man inside the circle. Thakur gives the batsman a tiiiiiny bit of a send-off."
26.2,4,"Thakur to Blundell, FOUR runs, hammers it down the ground! Blundell spots the half-volley, presses forward and gives it everything he's got to beat mid-off"
26.1,1,"Thakur to Guptill, 1 run, comes off as a fairly slow short ball seeing as he pretty much digs it into his own half of the pitch. Guptill pulls to deep square leg"
25.6,1,"Jadeja to Guptill, 1 run, attempts the late cut again and this time he's better prepared. Finds the gap past point after taking it off off stump"
25.5,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, dangerous shot, playing the cut to Jadeja, especially off the stumps. He bowls so quick that he can beat you and bowl you"
25.4,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, slides on with the arm and straight into the pad as Guptill tries to flick to midwicket"
25.3,1,"Jadeja to Blundell, 1 run, whip-pulls a short ball from outside off stump down to long-on"

24.5,0,"Thakur to Guptill, no run, steers the short ball to point"
24.4,4,"Thakur to Guptill, FOUR runs, picks it up and pummels it. Too easy when it's short at Thakur's pace. Here Guptill doesn't even have all that much room, but he still hits it so hard in front of midwicket"
24.3,0,"Thakur to Guptill, no run, stands tall and punches a back of a length ball to the right of short cover, but Kohli leaps to his right to stop any runs"
24.2,1,"Thakur to Blundell, 1 run, full on off stump, defends uncertainly towards midwicket"
24.1,0,"Thakur to Blundell, no run, there's his natural wristwork - he waits on the short ball outside off and even though it is on the rise, he is confident enough to get on top of it and whip to midwicket"
23.6,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, slides on straight to middle stump, Guptill blocks its progress"
23.5,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, misfield saves Blundell. He's more than halfway down the pitch after Guptill defends a good length ball towards point. There's where Manish Pandey is and somehow, inexplicably, he doesn't even pick up the ball properly"
23.4,1,"Chahal to Blundell, 1 run, excellent feet from Blundell, stepping out to get close to the ball on middle and whacking it down the ground"
23.3,0,"Chahal to Blundell, no run, lovely dip from Chahal. The ball is tossed up enough to drive the drive, but it drops very quickly, forcing Blundell to just defend"
23.2,1,"Chahal to Guptill, 1 run, loops it up a shade outside off as Guptill stretches forward to drive to long-off"
23.1,1,"Chahal to Blundell, 1 run, rocks back to slice a shortish delivery outside off through cover"

22.4,0,"Saini to Blundell, no run, charges out of his crease and is beaten by a little nip in off the pitch, Saini's good length ball, and his adjustment seeing the batsman charging to bowl closer to his body, works, beating the inside edge"
22.3,0,"Saini to Blundell, no run, oooh, that's nice. Saini angles a good length ball in towards middle stump and Blundell makes sure he plays straight and avoids being bowled"
22.2,1,"Saini to Guptill, 1 run, cramps him with a short ball at the body, Guptill pretty much just directs it to fine leg"
22.1,0,"Saini to Guptill, no run, defends a good length ball to cover"
21.6,1,"Jadeja to Guptill, 1 run, jabs it past the left of midwicket Ooooh, that ball takes a bit of the surface with it. Big puff of dust"
21.5,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, "
21.4,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, leading edge as Jadeja gives it a proper rip. He also makes sure the batsman can't reach the pitch, which is where Guptill is deceived as he plays into the leg side"
21.3,4,"Jadeja to Guptill, FOUR runs, glorious shot! Rocks back in his crease as soon as he sees a very rare Jadeja long hope and carves it behind point"
21.2,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, works it into the leg side"
21.1,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, huuuuuge appeal for lbw. Jadeja thinks it's pad first, but he can't convince his captain to review. The good length ball is fired into middle stump and replays suggest Guptill pretty much middled the ball. But whooooaaa! Replays show it does snick the pad first and ball-tracker says it would go on to hit the stumps as well! Definitely did not play like that to the naked eye!"
20.6,4,"Saini to Blundell, FOUR runs, whacks it again. This time he shows his ability against the short ball, picking the length early and dragging it from way outside off to pierce the gap at midwicket"
20.5,0,"Saini to Blundell, no run, shortish and on off stump, tries to dab it behind point for some runs. Doesn't happen"
20.4,4,"Saini to Blundell, FOUR runs, outstanding shot! A picture perfect straight drive to a ball that is nowhere near a half-volley. If he plays no other cricket, this one hit alone would show just how technically good Blundell is"
20.3,0,"Saini to Blundell, no run, shortish on off stump, knocks it down to midwicket, who attempts a no-look-backhand flick at the non-strikers and it pretty much goes as you expect it to - all the way out to long-off"
20.3,1,"Saini to Blundell, 1 wide, drifts down leg, which Blundell knows as he lets the ball go"
20.2,0,"Saini to Blundell, no run, nice and tight on off stump, which means Blundell has to settle for chopping the ball to backward point"
20.1,1,"Saini to Guptill, 1 run, nudges a back of a length ball off his pads through to deep midwicket"
19.6,1,"Jadeja to Guptill, 1 run, leans into the drive, opening the face to get it past cover"
19.5,1,"Jadeja to Blundell, 1 run, this time the length is a little short and it allows Blundell to rock back and whip it past the right of midwicket"
19.4,0,"Jadeja to Blundell, no run, tries to work the wicket-to-wicket line past midwicket. No good."
19.3,1,"Jadeja to Guptill, 1 run, opens the face and slides a good length ball on off stump through point"
19.2,1,"Jadeja to Blundell, 1 run, full and outside off, pushes to long-off"
19.1,0,"Jadeja to Blundell, no run, drives to cover"
18.6,6,"Chahal to Guptill, SIX runs, soars over the man leaping on that teeny tiny straight boundary. Shreyas Iyer is the man at long-off. He does well to track the ball. And be mindful of the ropes. Jumps as high as he could with both hands over his head, but Guptill's straight hits are usually good enough, even if this one comes off the bottom of the bat"
18.5,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, good length, outside off, defends"
18.4,2,"Chahal to Guptill, 2 runs, there's fifty! His first in 11 ODI innings and it comes as a result of a cut shot, a well controlled one, starting from his picking the length early and even benefiting from a misfield"
18.3,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, pushes towards mid-off"
18.2,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, beats him with a ripping legbreak. Plenty of turn. Plenty of bounce and again it is pitched wide of off stump to drag Guptill to play away from his body"
18.1,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, tosses it up outside off, defends"
17.6,0,"Jadeja to Blundell, no run, slows it up this time, the length quite full. Blundell gets his head over the ball and blocks it"
17.5,1,"Jadeja to Guptill, 1 run, a neat roll of the wrists takes care of a very quick ball on leg stump and sends it to the left of midwicket"
17.4,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, pushes it through on off stump, Guptill defends"
17.3,0,"Jadeja to Guptill, no run, tosses it up on off stump, lunges forward to defend"
17.2,1,"Jadeja to Blundell, 1 run, waits on it so nicely, meeting the straight ball under his eyes and working it behind square leg"
17.1,0,"Jadeja to Blundell, no run, keeps back to a good length ball on off stump and tries to work it past midwicket, no such luck"
16.6,1,"Chahal to Blundell, 1 run, having been dismissed by a wide ball in the last game, he gets one first up in this one. Smooth drive into the covers though"
16.5,7,"Chahal to Nicholls, OUT, With the DRS clock pretty much on zero, Nicholls makes the call to review an lbw decision! Phew! Anyway, here are the deets. Chahal dishes out a fairly quick and very flat legbreak. The batsman goes for a sweep but it's too straight for a shot like that and he misses completely. Umpire Oxenford thought it was adjacent enough and ball-tracker juuuuuuust about agrees with him. Clipping the very top of the outside edge of the leg stump. That is sooo toit!"
16.4,4,"Chahal to Nicholls, FOUR runs, lovely shot. For a moment, it looks as if Chahal has done well to adjust to Nicholls coming down the track, firing it on the pads. But the batsman is able to make sure his front foot somehow doesn't get in the way of a glorious flick shot over mid-on"
16.3,1,"Chahal to Guptill, 1 run, makes him reach outside off - that's Chahal's specialty - but Guptill has a looooong reach and that helps him control the cover drive"
16.2,1,"Chahal to Nicholls, 1 run, shimmies down to the pitch of the ball on leg stump and crunches it to long-on"
16.1,1,"Chahal to Guptill, 1 run, simple drive down the ground as he deals with a full ball cramping him"
16.1,1,"Chahal to Guptill, 1 wide, the legbreak wanders down legside, like an errant tourist not looking where they're going"
15.6,0,"Jadeja to Nicholls, no run, fired on a length on off, nearly 100ks, pushed back to the bowler"

14.5,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, flighted and attacking the stumps, played back to the bowler"
14.4,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, Has Chahal missed a return catch? It did carry, and the ball pops out. Yes, he has dropped it. On a length and breaks back in, Nicholls makes a bit of room and jabs it back to the bowler. This should've been taken"
14.3,1,"Chahal to Guptill, 1 run, darted on off stump, patted down to long-on off the front foot"
14.2,6,"Chahal to Guptill, SIX runs, Guptill doesn't middle this slog-sweep, but this is enough to fetch him a six at Eden Park. Shorter on off, drops down to one knee and drags it over midwicket"
14.1,1,"Chahal to Nicholls, 1 run, flatter and shorter outside off, Nicholls goes deep in the crease and punches a single down to long-off"
13.6,1,"Saini to Nicholls, 1 run, Nicholls swivels to meet a short ball on leg stump and pulls a single down to long leg. Nicely controlled even though he was cramped for room"
13.5,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, back of a length and skids back in to ping the thigh as Nicholls doesn't connect with a leg-side flick"
13.4,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, bumper outside off, 136ks, Nicholls ducks out of the way"

12.1,0,"Chahal to Guptill, no run, flighted on off, blocked to the leg side off the front foot"
11.6,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, short and nipping in, cramps Nicholls for room. He falls over and wears it on the pad"

11.4,4,"Saini to Nicholls, FOUR runs, dipping full-toss, just outside off, Nicholls simply drives through the line, straight of mid-off. Glorious batting from Nicholls"

9.2,0,"Thakur to Nicholls, no run, shorter and outside off, flashed to point off the back foot"
9.1,1,"Thakur to Guptill, 1 run, full and sliding in at off, tip and run to point. The make this single look so very easy"
8.6,4,"Saini to Nicholls, FOUR runs, shorter and outside off, not as quick, Nicholls has some room. He controls a pull and sends the ball rolling away to the midwicket fence. Top shot from a top batsman"
8.5,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, bumper down leg, too quick for Nicholls, as he is rushed into a hook and misses. Not a wide"

7.6,6,"Bumrah to Guptill, SIX runs, Guptill brings out the ramp, connects, and launches it into the second tier beyond third man. Not as short as the previous one, Guptill gets under it and gets it over the keeper's head in nonchalant fashion"

4.3,4,"Thakur to Nicholls, FOUR runs, shot, Henry! He holds the pose like a boss and admires this stellar straight drive. He takes a step out, on a length on middle, drills it on the up over Thakur's head. First boundary of the day"
4.2,1,"Thakur to Guptill, 1 run, driven through the line, but Guptill can't get it past mid-off. Test-match lines and lengths from Thakur, and he's finding some swing to boot"

2.5,0,"Thakur to Guptill, no run, lovely full inswinger from Thakur. He thinks he has his man lbw, but umpire Oxenford shoots down the appeal. Thakur wants a review, Kohli and Rahul decide against it. Guptill plays around his front pad and ekes out an inside edge to save himself"
2.4,1,"Thakur to Nicholls, 1 run, pitched up on off, tip and run to short cover. Nicholls was a bit late to respond to Guptill. The throw is to the striker's end, Guptill reaches the safety of his crease. Iyer can't throw the stumps down"

45.5,4,"Thakur to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs, oh, it's all rolling the Kiwi way right now! Fuller ball, off the inside edge, and through to fine leg. Fifty off just 21 balls!"

44.4,4,"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs, full toss, and he has whipped this away towards deep mid-wicket. I think the only challenge there was a bit of disbelief at how bad that ball was from Bumrah. Bad direction, and worse length!"
44.3,1,"Bumrah to Latham, 1 run, slower ball, off-cutter, and read to perfection. Just works this towards deep mid-wicket"
44.2,1,"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, 1 run, short of a length, into his body, and he does well to swat it away towards deep square leg. Did well to get it away from any fielder, just moving his body outside the line of that"

43.6,1,"Saini to Latham, 1 leg bye, slower bal, on the pads, and he looks to run it towards square leg. Off the thigh pad. Bowled at just 117kph"

43.5,4,"Saini to Latham, FOUR runs, skips down the wicket, and almost hammers that into the non-striker! Just pre-empts a back-of-a-length ball, and ends up drilling it straight down the ground past Saini"
43.4,1,"Saini to de Grandhomme, 1 run, length, has come back and struck him as he looks to flick it away. Given as runs, as the ball runs towards third man. Just an inside edge, according to the umpire then. India appeal, but don't review"

42.6,4,"Thakur to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs, short, around off, another change of pace one suspects, and he goes towards deep mid-wicket this time.

42.5,6,"Thakur to de Grandhomme, SIX runs, length, around off, and he has muscled this away on the on side. A knuckle ball from Thakur, and he just clears the square leg fence!"
42.4,1,"Thakur to Latham, 1 run, short, and he slaps this away towards deep mid-wicket. Would be a bit disappointed, Latham, considering this was a ball that could have fetched more than one"

41.4,1,"Chahal to Latham, 1 run, tossed up, and he skips down the wicket. Plays it with the inner part of the bat towards deep mid-wicket. Smart bit of batting"

41.2,2,"Chahal to de Grandhomme, 2 runs, lofted drive over cover to pick up two"
41.1,6,"Chahal to de Grandhomme, SIX runs, short, inviting, and he takes the bait! Chahal wants de Grandhomme to take on the fielder in the deep, and he doesn't time it that well, but still does enough to clear deep mid-wicket"

40.3,1,"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, 1 run, length, this has come back in and struck him on the pads as he shapes to play across the line. Perhaps a touch high, as it runs away towards third man. A few mini-appeals from Bumrah, but there is no support from around the field"
40.2,1,"Bumrah to Latham, 1 run, tip-and-run executed perfectly towards cover by Latham"
40.1,1,"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, 1 run, length, jags back in towards the batsman, who pushes it back down towards mid-on. Kohli comes around from mid-off, and has a shy with an underarm at the non-striker's end"
39.6,1,"Chahal to de Grandhomme, 1 run, length, and he has swung this towards deep square leg. It bounces short of Saini, and Kohli is livid with him for not going ahead and attacking the ball! CdG didn't seem to time it well, and in the end, it worked out to his advantage. That might have ended up as an easy catch"
39.5,1,"Chahal to Latham, 1 run, tossed up, and he drives with the turn towards wide mid-on"
39.4,1,"Chahal to de Grandhomme, 1 run, quicker one, possibly a flipper, and he looks to press forward to drive. Skews this away off the inside edge towards square leg"
39.3,7,"Chahal to Neesham, OUT, smacks this straight to mid-wicket! Tossed up a touch, and he looks to biff this away on the on side, but cannot get the elevation he wants. Kohli is in the way, and breaks into a wide grin as he accepts this catch. He knows that the game is well within India's reach..."
39.2,1,"Chahal to Latham, 1 run, down the leg side, and he looks to sweep. Off the gloves and goes towards fine leg"
39.1,1,"Chahal to Neesham, 1 bye, slider, and beats the batsman, and Rahul. Through his legs, as the batsman looked to stretch and defend this. Top bowling!"

38.5,1,"Bumrah to Neesham, 1 run, length, and he runs it down to third man"
38.4,0,"Bumrah to Neesham, no run, length, goes down leg as it strikes Neesham on the pad, angling across him. Betas him a bit for pace. May have been a touch high too"

38.2,0,"Bumrah to Latham, no run, length, jags back in from around off, and takes the inside edge on to his thigh. Could have gone on to stumps so easily!"

36.5,0,"Saini to Neesham, no run, good response! Length, just around off, and he looks to press forward and run it down towards third man again. Beaten with the natural angle of that"
36.4,4,"Saini to Neesham, FOUR runs, run past the keeper! Saini offers some width again, and Neesham just runs it to the third man boundary. Very deliberate, and smart too!"
36.3,2,"Saini to Neesham, 2 runs, length, but width too, and he can run this down towards third man. To the deep fielder's left, and that allows two quite easily"
36.2,0,"Saini to Neesham, no run, length, around off, and he blocks this straight down the wicket"
36.1,2,"Saini to Neesham, 2 runs, full, down the leg side, and he looks to flick this away. Towards fine leg, and Chahal comes in from the deep backward square leg region, and saves two with a sprawling stop"

35.5,1,"Jadeja to Latham, 1 run, length, and he whips this towards mid-wicket"

35.3,1,"Jadeja to Latham, 1 run, goes back and whips this from outside off towards deep mid-wicket"

35.1,4,"Jadeja to Latham, FOUR runs, length, and he hangs back in his crease, and punches this throug the cover-point region, against the spin, beautifully!"
34.6,0,"Thakur to Neesham, no run, length, straight again, an defended towards point"
34.5,6,"Thakur to Neesham, SIX runs, short, and he rocks back and takes on the man in the deep at deep point with an uppish cut. He needn't bother...this has cleared that man comfortably to his right!"
34.4,0,"Thakur to Neesham, no run, dug in a bit short. Neesham looks to take full toll of it with a pull, but that slides under his bat. Perhaps kept lower than what the batsman anticipated"
34.3,0,"Thakur to Neesham, no run, length, very straight in line, and he plays this towards cover from the crease"
34.2,1,"Thakur to Latham, 1 run, shorter, and wider, and he plays it towards Jadeja at point. They set off, and Jadeja has a shy at the non-striker's end. Misses. That would have been tight!"
34.1,0,"Thakur to Latham, no run, length, tidy line just outside off, and he presses forward to defend"
33.6,0,"Chahal to Neesham, no run, googly, and he goes back and plays this towards square leg with a defensive push"
33.5,1,"Chahal to Latham, 1 run, skips down the wicket, and then works this with the turn from outside off, towards deep square leg. Smart shot, but a touch risky with that leg gully in place..."

32.6,1,"Thakur to Neesham, 1 run, fullish length, played away wide of cover. Easy single to get Neesham going"
32.5,7,"Thakur to Nicholls, OUT, caught behind. Short and wide outside off, going across him. The bounce perhaps did him in, he was staying low to cut this through the offside but ends up getting an edge that flies through to the keeper."

32.3,0,"Thakur to Nicholls, no run, length ball on the stumps, tries to flick it but gets an inside edge onto pad and it rolls to cover. Shardul was excited by it but there was an inside edge"

32.1,0,"Thakur to Nicholls, no run, fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"

31.5,7,"Jadeja to Taylor, OUT, pops a catch to short cover. Did that hold on the pitch a bit? Taylor was coming forward to punch this, was too early into the shot and the ball loops up tamely to the fielder there. First dismissal in the series for Taylor"
31.4,1,"Jadeja to Nicholls, 1 run, length ball on the pads, uses his wrists to whip this past short fine leg"
31.3,1,"Jadeja to Taylor, 1 run, fuller outside off, slap-driven through cover"
31.2,4,"Jadeja to Taylor, FOUR runs, short and wide outside off, he waits for it and cuts it powerfully through point. No fielder back there"

29.2,1,"Jadeja to Taylor, 1 run, direct hit by KL Rahul at the bowler's end. This was a length outside off, turning away. Taylor played it with the turn into the offside and responded to the call for a single. Quick off the blocks after some hesitation. Rahul ran around picked it up and hit direct, but Taylor had made it"
29.1,0,"Jadeja to Taylor, no run, speared in on the stumps, turned to midwicket"
28.6,1,"Saini to Taylor, 1 run, fuller outside off, driven to mid-off, they take the tight single."
28.6,1,"Saini to Taylor, 1 wide, lost control of that one, full toss that slipped out of his hand and wen down leg. Called a wide. Close to a no-ball too but just under the waist"
28.5,1,"Saini to Nicholls, 1 run, length on the fourth stump, skilfully runs it down to third man, staying still and opening the bat face"
28.4,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, fuller outside off, driven firmly. Mid-off goes to his left to cut it off"
28.3,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, goes wide of off stump now, across the left-hander. Nicholls drives it to mid-off with a horizontal bat"
28.2,4,"Saini to Nicholls, FOUR runs, and now he pulls in front of square! this is not as short, and it's still on leg stump. It should be cramping him but he's moving into position early and so well balanced, he's able to unleash a fierce pull to this also"
28.1,4,"Saini to Nicholls, FOUR runs, dismissed. Not a terrible ball, short and on leg stump to try and cramp him but Nicholls rocked back and was in position early to pull this to deep square leg"
27.6,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, length ball, might have been a bit quicker, flicked to midwicket"

27.4,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, good length outside off, pushed towards gully"

27.2,0,"Chahal to Taylor, no run, good length dipping on him, he takes a big stride to smother it"
27.1,7,"Chahal to Williamson, OUT, he's whipped this straight to midwicket. Kane Williamson will be filthy with himself for that. It was a long hop, sat up and he could have smashed it anywhere, but picked out Agarwal at midwicket. India have an important breakthrough"
26.6,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, good finish by Saini with a quick bumper on leg stump that the batsman has to duck under"
26.5,2,"Saini to Nicholls, 2 runs, fuller outside off, driven to mid-off. The fielder has a shy - not needed perhaps because the batsmen weren't running - and it hits the stumps direct and goes to fine leg resulting in two overthrows. Kohli was the fielder."
26.4,4,"Saini to Nicholls, FOUR runs, bowls it back of a length outside off, sits up and Nicholls rocks back to thrash this through midwicket. Made use of the free hit that time"
26.4,1,"Saini to Nicholls, 1 no ball, length ball outside off and he's been called for a no-ball again. This time he did over-step"

25.2,1,"Chahal to Nicholls, 1 run, fuller on the stumps, worked off his pad through midwicket"

24.6,1,"Bumrah to Nicholls, 1 run, length outside off, runs it down to third man"
24.5,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, after taking the previous one away, Bumrah bowls this into the batsman, who punches to mid-on"

23.3,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, down the track, Chahal bowls it on he pad to cramp him, he manages to pad it away and scrambles back inside the crease"
23.2,1,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run, pushes forward with soft hands to mid-off and takes a quick single"
23.1,4,"Chahal to Williamson, FOUR runs, thwacked. Too short and Williamson has all the time in the world to rock back and smack this to the midwicket boundary"
22.6,4,"Bumrah to Nicholls, FOUR runs, lovely shot. Full on the pads, he flicks it off his toes and beats midwicket. Such good timing on that, it races all the way to the boundary. And with that, he's also brought up his fifty."

22.4,1,"Bumrah to Nicholls, 1 run, length ball on the pads, turned to square leg"

22.1,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, length ball on off, punched to point"
21.6,1,"Jadeja to Nicholls, 1 run, fuller, tries to flick it off his pads. Not well timed, pops in the air but well clear of midwicket in the circle. Long-on fields"
21.5,0,"Jadeja to Nicholls, no run, down the track, gets to the pitch and defends back to the bowler"
21.4,0,"Jadeja to Nicholls, no run, tossed up outside off, driven. Gets a thick outside edge that rolls to point"

19.1,0,"Jadeja to Williamson, no run, tossed up fuller, slapped back to the bowler"
18.6,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, some nice drift there by Chahal and loop, drawing him forward down the track. The drift's taking the ball away but he manages to push it into the offside. 'No pace on the ball boys,' says Kohli gleefully."
18.5,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, dips and skids onto him, he misses the flick by a long way while staying back and is struck on the pads. Chahal is interested, the umpire isn't."

16.3,7,"Chahal to Guptill, OUT, beautiful! Tosses this up a touch more, and Guptill stretches to defend as it drifts in towards leg stump. Turns across him and hits the top of off. That's a dream ball for a leg-spinner to bowl, and perhaps the only way that Guptill could have fallen today. He's given his team a massive headstart, though"

10.4,6,"Thakur to Guptill, SIX runs, gets to fifty in style! Dug in short, and outside off, but he is seeing the ball like a rugby ball right now (only bigger, and more spherical!) Whips this away towards deep square leg, and it goes beyond the boundary"
10.3,1,"Thakur to Nicholls, 1 run, length, but too straight, and he can whip this away towards deep backward square leg"
10.2,0,"Thakur to Nicholls, no run, fuller, thrown a touch wider, and Nicholls hangs his bat out. A nothing shot, to be honest, and lucky that this doesn't catch the outside edge on its way through to the keeper."
10.1,1,"Thakur to Guptill, 1 run, dug in short, and he plays this away towards square leg"
9.6,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, length, drives this towards cover-point. Rifled in at the striker's end, and there's no backing up, but New Zealand don't want to risk going for a risky overthrow"

8.2,0,"Thakur to Nicholls, no run, fuller, and he drives this towards cover with the full face of the blade"
8.1,0,"Thakur to Nicholls, no run, length, a bit of movement back in from outside off, and he looks to drive this back. Off the inside edge, on to pad, but safe"
7.6,4,"Chahal to Guptill, FOUR runs, short, and he pulls this well ahead of square on the on side. There's a deep mid-wicket in place, but this has been placed well to the left of the man, there, more where wide long-on could be said to be"
7.5,1,"Chahal to Nicholls, 1 run, drives a ball closer to him towards long-on"
7.4,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, length, and he allows this to turn back from outside off, and defends towards mid-on"
7.3,1,"Chahal to Guptill, 1 run, fuller, and he presses forward to play this around his front pad towards deep mid-wicket"
7.2,1,"Chahal to Nicholls, 1 run, googly, but too full, and Nicholls whips this away towards deep mid-wicket"
7.1,0,"Chahal to Nicholls, no run, length, driven towards mid-on"
6.6,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, length, punched to cover. Right off the middle again, making that sweet 'CRRRUNCH' sound!"
6.5,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, back of a length, moves back in a touch, and he gets an inside edge as he looks to defend. On to pad and down by the batsman"
6.4,4,"Bumrah to Guptill, FOUR runs, a bit fuller, and then he drills this past the bowler. Nothing more than a straight bat push down the ground, but timed supremely well to the long-off fence!"
6.3,6,"Bumrah to Guptill, SIX runs, short, and dispatched beyond mid-wicket! Guptill picks the length of this very quickly, rocks back a touch and then whiplashes this away on the on side. Superb bat speed!"
6.2,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, back of a length, and slapped hard towards point. Mayank Agarwal does well to get down and stop that. Would have been four if he'd missed"
6.1,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, length, and he plays it towards short mid-wicket"
5.6,4,"Saini to Nicholls, FOUR runs, fuller, outside off, and he drives this beautifully down the ground. No chance for mid-off, who sets off hoping to cut it off to his left, but then has the sole responsibility of bringing this back from beyond the boundary!"
5.5,1,"Saini to Guptill, 1 run, length, around off, and he defends towards point. Enough room to go through for a single"
5.4,0,"Saini to Guptill, no run, back of a length, cutting back in, and he defends on the hop"
5.3,0,"Saini to Guptill, no run, length, and he slashes this hard, looking for the point boundary. Jadeja at backward point is able to stop it"
5.2,4,"Saini to Guptill, FOUR runs, on the pads again, and he whips this away towards the unprotected mid-wicket region. Bad bowling considering he has a 6-3 field"
5.1,6,"Saini to Guptill, SIX runs, full, on the pads, and he whips this away towards deep square leg...and well over it! This is just strong wristwork, and good hand-eye coordination"
4.6,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, defends a length ball around off"
4.5,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, length, and he defends this as it angles across him from leg stump"
4.4,1,"Bumrah to Guptill, 1 leg bye, length, down the pads, and off the thigh pad as he looks to whip it away. Goes scurrying along the carpet towards fine leg"
4.3,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, length, cuts back in from outside off, and he defends"
4.2,1,"Bumrah to Nicholls, 1 run, oh, good ball! Not a lot of lateral movement, but quick and angles across him. Nicholls is opened up a touch, and even gets an outside edge, but that flies through the vacant gully region towards third man"
4.1,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, back of a length, pitching around leg and tucking him up further. Defends off the back foot"
3.6,3,"Saini to Nicholls, 3 runs, attractive cover drive, to a length ball offering some width, and that goes through the infield. Teases Shardul Thakur, who pursues the ball from mid-off, and he is able to pull it back ahead of the cover boundary"
3.5,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, length, just nibbles away from outside off, and he taps this towards cover-point"
3.4,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, length, straight again, and he plays this towards mid-on. There's a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but Guptill stays inside"
3.3,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, back of a length, straight, driven back towards the bowler with a straight ball"
3.2,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, length, driven back towards Saini, who half-stops it himself on his follow through"
3.1,0,"Saini to Nicholls, no run, length, and he check-drives this towards mid-off"
2.6,1,"Bumrah to Nicholls, 1 run, fuller, on the pads, and he ticks this along towards fine leg to retain strike"
2.5,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, length, zips across him at 140kph, and he plays over the line of this. Beaten all ends up, though he could easily have left that alone..."

2.3,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, length, and he plays this away towards point"
2.2,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, length, and he defends from the crease"
2.1,2,"Bumrah to Nicholls, 2 runs, defends a length ball around off, and Guptill calls him through for a quick single"
1.6,6,"Saini to Guptill, SIX runs, off the lower part of the bat, but very much deliberate! Saini digs it in short, but strays down the leg side. Guptill can just move inside the line of this, and help it over fine leg"
1.5,0,"Saini to Guptill, no run, looks to make room to go straight down the ground. Saini follows him with a sharp off-cutter. Off the inside edge, on to pad, and down to ground"

1.3,0,"Saini to Guptill, no run, length, and he defends this towards cover"
1.2,0,"Saini to Guptill, no run, defends a back-of-a-length ball shaping back in from outside off"
1.1,4,"Saini to Guptill, FOUR runs, lucky! Presses a touch forward to defend a fuller ball around off, and that takes the inside edge and runs away to fine leg. That could have easily rattled the stumps!"
0.6,0,"Bumrah to Nicholls, no run, length, around off, and left alone"
0.5,3,"Bumrah to Guptill, 3 runs, fuller, and he skews this off the inside of the bat, but gets it past short mid-wicket. The man there goes chasing after, as does mid-on, and between the two of them, they are able to save one"
0.4,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, length, just around off, and he plays inside the line of this! Better line, and the perfect length to go with Bumrah's pace"
0.3,4,"Bumrah to Guptill, FOUR runs, a bit short, and he hangs back. This isn't very quick either, and offers him some width. He slashes this away past point to the cover-point fence"
0.2,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, length, around off, and he defends this"
0.1,0,"Bumrah to Guptill, no run, length, around off, and defended towards point"
49.6,4,"Southee to Saini, FOUR runs, low full toss, Saini gets down on one knee and slams it over mid-off. Nobody back at the boundary so he'll finish off the innings with a four."
49.5,1,"Southee to Jadeja, 1 run, full toss outside off, Jadeja will feel like he's missed out, slashed it straight to point. Jadeja runs for the single, Saini is slow to respond. Makes it safely because there is no direct hit"
49.5,1,"Southee to Jadeja, 1 wide, down the track and Southee goes for the full and wide ball again. This time it's too far outside off so he'll have to rebowl it"
49.4,4,"Southee to Jadeja, FOUR runs, clever from Jadeja. Moved well across and instead of trying to drive it, lifted it over short fine leg"
49.3,0,"Southee to Jadeja, no run, superb bowling. Going across him but shortens his length, while making the batsman expect a fuller ball. Jadeja misses with the cut. He was asking for it to be a wide but had moved across"
49.2,1,"Southee to Saini, 1 bye, Southee follows the Bennett template, bowls it short and outside off. Saini misses again but Jadeja has sprinted down and called Saini through. Good work from Latham to hit the stumps direct, but Jadeja is so quick he's made it."
49.1,1,"Southee to Jadeja, 1 run, full and well across him. Jadeja reaches for it and steers it to third man"
48.6,0,"Bennett to Saini, no run, and he follows the same template. Gets it a bit closer to off this time and the ball goes past at midriff height rather than near shoulders - but the same result. Swing and a miss"
48.5,0,"Bennett to Saini, no run, same ball, same result. Good bowling this. Banging it in and getting it high enough that the tailender is going to have trouble with connecting"
48.4,0,"Bennett to Saini, no run, short outside off, slower ball. Misses it completely trying to slog across the line"
48.3,4,"Bennett to Saini, FOUR runs, inside edge goes past the stumps. The bowler has his hands on his head. Saini cleared his front leg and wanted to swat it on the offside, but he swings more in hope than with conviction. Gets an inside edge that eludes the stumps and goes past a diving Latham too."
48.2,7,"Bennett to Thakur, OUT, caught at deep square leg but they are going upstairs to check if it's a no-ball. Perhaps for height? A yorker gone wrong ends up as a full toss and Shardul swipes across the line. Gets it near the end of the bat, more height than distance. Travels very high and de Grandhomme does well to keep his eyes on it and hold on. Not a no-ball, and Shardul has to walk back."
48.1,0,"Bennett to Thakur, no run, full ball on the sixth stump line. Shardul had an almighty swing at it. went too hard and missed it completely"
47.6,1,"Southee to Thakur, 1 run, full and straight, he bashes it straight back too by going well back. Not timed well enough to beat long-on, who runs to his left to field"
47.5,1,"Southee to Jadeja, 1 run, fuller outside off, gives himself room and drives, but straight to cover"
47.4,1,"Southee to Thakur, 1 run, superb yorker on the fifth stump, Shardul inside edges onto the ground. Jadeja sprints through for a quick single with the ball bouncing into the ground and towards short leg"
47.3,1,"Southee to Jadeja, 1 run, direct hit from Williamson at mid-off but Jadeja has made it. Short outside off, no timing on it as he tries to pull. Too late on it and it goes only to mid-off. Good work by Williamson but Jadeja was safely home"
47.3,1,"Southee to Jadeja, 1 wide, very far across the batsman. Too far across and it'll be another wide."
47.2,1,"Southee to Thakur, 1 run, length ball on the stumps, he has a big mow across the line, to deep midwicket"
47.1,4,"Southee to Thakur, FOUR runs, length ball on leg stump and he whips a pull into the gap at square leg to get a boundary first up"
47.1,1,"Southee to Thakur, 1 wide, too far down leg and he'll have to rebowl that."
46.6,0,"Bennett to Jadeja, no run, fuller length going across him, steered to point"
46.5,7,"Bennett to Pandey, OUT, caught at long-on and India are losing their way at the death. Pandey wanted to execute one of his lofted straight drives. Didn't get as underneath the ball as he would have wanted to, and lifts it to long-on, where Santner comes forward and takes a tumbling catch."
46.4,7,"Bennett to Rahul, OUT, Jamieson takes the catch this time and he flings the ball angrily at his miss last ball. Short of a length, Rahul is a little cramped for room and gets it higher on the bat than ideal while trying to pull. Jamieson runs to his right at long-off and holds on."
46.3,6,"Bennett to Rahul, SIX runs, bursts through Jamieson's hands at long-off!. That's poor fielding. It was a brilliant looking shot, driven inside out to wide long-off. Jamieson is right there and the ball is at comfortable catching height just above his head. Goes through his hands and is a six."
46.2,1,"Bennett to Pandey, 1 run, slower ball yorker, he had to wait for it having planted his front foot down, ends up driving it to long-on"
46.1,1,"Bennett to Rahul, 1 run, length outside off, he was clearing his front leg to try and mow it, but can only flat bat it to long-on"
45.6,1,"Santner to Rahul, 1 run, flat and fired into the batsman, who has to make room and punch to long-on"
45.5,1,"Santner to Pandey, 1 run, drifts on the pads and is worked to deep midwicket"
45.4,2,"Santner to Pandey, 2 runs, misfield by Jamieson at short third man allows a second. Rahul stayed still that time and opened the bat face to steer it fine"
45.3,1,"Santner to Rahul, 1 run, goes for the reverse sweep, doesn't quite nail it. Top edge loops over the keeper and short third man runs to his left to field"
45.2,1,"Santner to Pandey, 1 run, down the track, but Santner sees him and bowls it flatter and shorter, he can only push it through cover"
45.1,1,"Santner to Rahul, 1 run, fired in on leg stump, steered away by opening the face and they take a single"
44.6,1,"Bennett to Rahul, 1 run, tailing into him, tried to flick it off his toes but gets an inside edge that hits pad rolls towards point"
44.5,0,"Bennett to Rahul, no run, moved well across, but the bowler bowled a well disguised slower on and it goes between bat and pad"
44.4,1,"Bennett to Pandey, 1 run, full toss outside off, driven to long-on"
44.3,1,"Bennett to Rahul, 1 run, back of a length, pulled to long-on"
44.2,2,"Bennett to Rahul, 2 runs, length ball outside off, sweeps it with good timing to deep square leg's right and they can push for two which means it's a century for KL Rahul. What a tour he's had. And this has been a fine innings, where he had to consolidate at the start but has kept the run-rate ticking"
44.1,2,"Bennett to Rahul, 2 runs, short outside off, swats a pull down to long-on. The fielder's deep so they sprint two"
43.6,1,"Santner to Rahul, 1 run, makes room but he fires it in quick and flat on off, driven to the bowler's left"
43.5,2,"Santner to Rahul, 2 runs, fuller on the stumps, flicked through midwicket"
43.4,1,"Santner to Pandey, 1 run, there's a potential run-out here. But Manish Pandey is saved because Santner took both bails off before he had the ball in hand. His right knee brushed the stumps and took off the bails. If he had gathered cleanly, he could have run Pandey out. Pandey had tried to work it away, but the ball didn't travel too far. They go for the quick single, Pandey a bit slow to respond. Latham runs to the ball gathers and throws it, but Santner has already dislodged the bails before collecting the ball."
43.3,0,"Santner to Pandey, no run, fires it in on off, steered into the offside, but straight to point"
43.2,0,"Santner to Pandey, no run, length on off, driven to cover"

42.4,1,"Jamieson to Rahul, 1 run, pushed softly towards cover for a quick single"
42.3,0,"Jamieson to Rahul, no run, just out of reach of Jamieson. Excellent ball, bouncer that rises up above his shoulder outside off. Rahul wanted to pull, got a toe-end that made the ball pop up and drop. Jamieson was in his follow through and had to run and dive to his right. the ball fell inches from his fingers."
42.2,0,"Jamieson to Rahul, no run, length ball nipping back in, tries to turn it but can't connect cleanly. the ball rolls down the pitch"
42.1,6,"Jamieson to Rahul, SIX runs, dismissed. Length ball that was sliding down leg, he moves inside and almost nonchalantly swats a pull over fine leg. Way over."
41.6,4,"Santner to Pandey, FOUR runs, beautifully done. Down the track, gets to the pitch and drives it straight over the bowler's head. No fielders there and it pings into the straight boundary"
41.5,1,"Santner to Rahul, 1 run, flatter and quicker, goes back and across to whip to long-on using his wrists"
41.4,1,"Santner to Pandey, 1 run, length ball, turned to midwicket"
41.3,3,"Santner to Rahul, 3 runs, that one turned and bounced! Took the batsman and keeper by surprise.Rahul was shaping to cut, but it took the outside edge and went past the keeper. Not really fair to call it a chance, it came so quickly and he was standing up to the stumps"
41.2,1,"Santner to Pandey, 1 run, down the track, wanted to send it in orbit, but gets it off the inside half of the bat and it bounces to long-on"
41.1,1,"Santner to Rahul, 1 run, flatter on the pads, worked to long-on. The fielder was deep so the batsmen were considering a second but decide against it"

40.2,1,"Jamieson to Rahul, 1 run, length outside off, he moves across and paddles this to fine leg"
40.1,0,"Jamieson to Rahul, no run, fuller on the stumps, punched back softly. The bowler fields on his follow through"

39.2,1,"Santner to Pandey, 1 run, flatter on the stumps, he makes room and slaps it through cover"
39.1,2,"Santner to Pandey, 2 runs, fuller outside off, he goes inside out over cover. There is a man on the point fence, so he can run to his left and cut it off before the boundary"
38.6,1,"Jamieson to Pandey, 1 run, stopped on the pitch a little and he was too early into his drive. The ball hung in the air a bit but fell short of the bowler and away to his right, trickles past to mid-on"

38.4,1,"Jamieson to Rahul, 1 run, strays down leg and is tucked to fine leg"

37.6,4,"Santner to Rahul, FOUR runs, nicely done - by the batsman. Bad ball, straying down leg and he takes advantaged, sweeping it very fine to collect a boundary"
37.5,0,"Santner to Rahul, no run, flatter and quicker on the stumps, pushed to cover"
37.4,2,"Santner to Rahul, 2 runs, given some air outside off, takes a stride forward and opens the face of the bat to guide it to third man. Played with soft hands and they come back for the second"

36.5,1,"Neesham to Pandey, 1 run, direct hit and Rahul was a goner. Mitch Santner at cover had plenty of time but he misses the stumps. This was driven firmly and Pandey set off for a single. Rahul responded but seemed to have given up nearing the crease, knowing that a direct hit would send him back."
36.4,2,"Neesham to Pandey, 2 runs, fuller on off, opens the face of the bat to drive through backward point. Splendid running again by the two batsmen to pick up two"

35.3,1,"Southee to Pandey, 1 run, too short, sits up, swatted to deep square leg. There is protection in the deep so the bowler gets away with that"

34.4,1,"Neesham to Pandey, 1 run, length outside off, stroked through point"
34.3,0,"Neesham to Pandey, no run, hung in the air but falls short of mid-on. Slower ball that he pushed at too early, and it popped up off his intended punch to mid-on, but falls safe"

30.5,2,"Neesham to Pandey, 2 runs, full-blooded drive on the up over covers. There's no fielder in the deep in that region, and that makes it a safe shot. Not off the middle, and it allows them to come back for two"

25.3,1,"Jamieson to Rahul, 1 run, length, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket again and picks up a single. Good urgency being shown by the two"

15.6,0,"Southee to Rahul, no run, length ball, nipping into him. Southee appeals but the umpire's not interested. New Zealand won't go for the review. That was probably too high and going down leg, but it did beat the batsman's push and struck him on his pad"

12.1,7,"Bennett to Shaw, 1 run, OUT, Shaw might be run out here. The bowler strays down the pads, and is flicked to fine leg. Looked like there was more than enough time to come back for two with the ball hit to de Grandhomme's right, but Shaw was scrambling to make it. Good through, right on top of the stumps, and despite a despairing dive, replays confirm that Shaw is short of his ground. A promising innings has ended, and the batsman's disappointed with himself."

9.4,1,"Jamieson to Iyer, 1 run, fuller, tapped to midwicket's right"
9.3,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, beaten. Went slightly wider of the crease to create the angle into the batsman and got it to straighten, to whizz past the edge"
9.2,0,"Jamieson to Iyer, no run, defended towards point. He thinks about a quick single but is turned down - rightly so."
9.1,4,"Jamieson to Iyer, FOUR runs, Iyer gets into the act now. Full ball outside off, and he goes through with the drive though the bat turned in his hand and gets enough meat on it to go over cover and into the bouncary"
8.6,6,"Bennett to Shaw, SIX runs, Shaw's taken a fancy to Bennett. Short and wide outside off again, he cracks it over point. Lovely balance, superb execution. And it's gone over the boundary too, for another six."
8.5,4,"Bennett to Shaw, FOUR runs, lovely. Back of a length outside off, he waits for it and punches to point's right. The ball screams across the turf into the boundary"
8.4,0,"Bennett to Shaw, no run, length outside off, punched to point"
8.3,6,"Bennett to Shaw, SIX runs, cracked. Bouncer that climbed to his helmet level outside off, but he goes for the hook and connects beautifully, sends it soaring over midwicket"

6.5,0,"Bennett to Shaw, no run, length ball outside off, defended"
6.4,7,"Bennett to Kohli, OUT, caught at third man. That's an odd shot. Kohli shuffled across because the New Zealand bowlers have been banging it back of a length outside off, and tried to slash this. He wanted to send it over point perhaps but it balloons up to Jamieson at third man instead who has to take a couple of steps forward and go low in front to hold on."
6.3,1,"Bennett to Shaw, 1 run, length outside off, not quite short enough to pull. Shaw goes on the back foot and pulls anyway, gets it through midwicket off the bottom edge"
6.3,1,"Bennett to Shaw, 1 wide, banged in short outside off again but too far outside and it's the first wide of the innings"
6.2,0,"Bennett to Shaw, no run, back of a length outside off - that's an area they have preferred bowling to Shaw - and he dabs it back to the bowler"

4.2,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, back of a length outside off, moves across and pushes to cover point"
4.1,6,"Southee to Kohli, SIX runs, imperious. Kohli's had enough of being beaten, just disdainfully steps down the track and executes a perfect short-arm pull that sends the ball flying over long-on"
3.6,4,"Jamieson to Shaw, FOUR runs, shot. First boundary of the innings. Loose ball, short and wide outside off and he lashes it through the covers"
3.5,0,"Jamieson to Shaw, no run, back of a length outside off, too late on the punch, it hung in the air for a while but dropped well short of the bowler"
3.4,1,"Jamieson to Kohli, 1 run, well bowled and well played. Banged in short outside off, and rears up unexpectedly. Kohli gets his hands up in time and dabs it down to third man"
3.3,0,"Jamieson to Kohli, no run, lovely. What a ball. Comes down from a height at pace, pitches on a length on off and jags away. Just past the outside edge"
3.2,0,"Jamieson to Kohli, no run, back of a length outside off, Kohli thinks about playing it but gets his bat out of the way"
3.1,1,"Jamieson to Shaw, 1 run, back of a length but straying down leg, he rocks back and connects well with the pull, but there is a deep backward square leg, who takes it on the bounce"
2.6,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, full and wide outside off, Kohli gets bat on it, strokes it to point"
2.5,0,"Southee to Kohli, no run, beaten again! A touch fuller, and gets it to nibble away slightly. Kohli's looking to flick it from a fifth stump line, misses"

2.1,0,"Southee to Shaw, no run, Fullish outside off, pushed to cover"

1.5,0,"Jamieson to Agarwal, no run, gets the length fuller, movement away from the batsman again, but he lets it go through outside off"
1.4,3,"Jamieson to Shaw, 3 runs, lovely shot. Stood up on his toes, and punched off the back foot through point."
1.3,0,"Jamieson to Shaw, no run, that height of Jamieson is being put to good use. He's banging it in just short of a length but getting considerable lift. This one zooms past on the fifth stump"
1.2,0,"Jamieson to Shaw, no run, beaten. Lovely delivery. Hits a length and gets it to move away, snakes past the poking outside edge."
1.1,0,"Jamieson to Shaw, no run, banged in on a length outside off and defended off the back foot."

19.5,0,"Thakur to Sodhi, no run, length outside off again, it was in  the slot but slightly wider than the ones he deposited into the stands, and for all the drama we've seen so far, nine off one is unlikely to happen"

19.3,0,"Thakur to Sodhi, no run, goes full, yorker just outside off, Sodhi can't get any bat on it"
19.2,6,"Thakur to Sodhi, SIX runs, length on middle, Sodhi makes room and cracks this high into the night sky and deep onto the grass banks at deep midwicket, that's massive, massive six"
19.1,0,"Thakur to Sodhi, no run, knuckle ball, outside off, swings too early and misses"
18.6,0,"Bumrah to Bennett, no run, full around off, Bennett's blocks this and takes the game into the final over"

16.5,7,"Thakur to Kuggeleijn, OUT, similar script unfolding here in Mount Maunganui, with New Zealand losing their way from a seemingly comfortable position! Short, quick one, Kuggeleijn pulls but is hurried for pace, gets it high on the bat and straight down deep square-leg's throat. Taylor's left stranded with the tail, with plenty to do and a Bumrah over left. Great over from Thakur"
16.4,1,"Thakur to Taylor, 1 run, short one, keeps climbing, Taylor gloves it away on to the off side for one"
16.3,7,"Thakur to Santner, OUT, holes out to long-on! Santner never got enough of it, it was another knuckle ball angled across, he went down-town but mistimed it, pressure mounts on Taylor, who will now be on strike"

9.5,6,"Dube to Taylor, SIX runs, there's the hockey-swipe over midwicket. This is Ross Taylor that IPL star. Pitched up and outside off, smoked away with great authority. Poor lengths from Dube"
9.5,5,"Dube to Taylor, (no ball) FOUR runs, overpitched on off stump, Taylor picks it up and whips it to the midwicket fence. Washington runs in from the boundary, slips, and lets the ball ping the rope once again. Okay, that's a front-foot no-ball from Dube"

8.1,2,"Chahal to Seifert, 2 runs, on a length and outside off, slog-swept away to deep midwicket. Seifert wants two...and might well be caught short on the second. Good flat throw from Iyer, Rahul gathers it and disturbs the stumps. But a desperate full-length dive saves Seifert"
7.6,2,"Thakur to Taylor, 2 runs, much fuller and outside off, another hockey-swipe from Taylor. Samson throws himself to his right and aims to catch the high ball at the midwicket boundary.

3.2,7,"Saini to Seifert, OUT, there's a mix-up between the wickets and India take advantage of it. Seifert slaps it to cover-point and is very eager to get across to the other end, he's just ball-watching. Bruce, though, isn't as eager. As a result, there's some hesitation, and Samson swoops down on the ball and throws it to the striker's end. India's stand-in captain Rahul rushes in from behind the stumps, dives forward, collects the throw calmly and disturbs the stumps to send back Bruce"

1.3,7,"Bumrah to Guptill, OUT, is height an issue? but umpire Haig raises his finger. Guptill chats to Munro and decides against a review. He walks off for 2. Back of a length, angling in from outside off, skids off the pitch to cramp Guptill for room and ping him on the back pad in line with the stumps. The tracker might have returned umpire's call on height. Okay, the tracker shows it might have bounced over. Guptill is gone, though"

18.3,0,"Kuggeleijn to Dube, no run, shorter and quicker, Dube is beaten for pace and toe ends it back to the bowler"
18.2,0,"Kuggeleijn to Dube, no run, slower ball, return chance put down! It was pushed wide of Dube who had to reach for it, pushed it back aerially without much power but Kuggeleijn still had to change direction and couldn't quite hang on"

15.3,1,"Ngidi to Denly, 1 run, short outside off, Denly makes a horrible mess of it trying to pull and Shamsi puts him down! Went to him pretty quickly at backward square leg in the circle, and couldn't quite grab it"
15.2,1,"Ngidi to Root, 1 run, back-of-a-length ball, tip-and-run into the covers and just about safe. Bavuma's throw wouldn't have been miles away from running Root out, but strikes him on the leg"
15.1,4,"Ngidi to Root, FOUR runs, back of a length outside the off stump, Root opens the face with minimal effort and guides it down through third man for four, very fine -- a shot you've seen 100 times before"
14.6,1,"Shamsi to Root, 1 run, tossed up on off, Root punches to mid-off and takes on the fielder's arm... could have been tight as he dived for his ground, but a muddy shirt is all it costs him"
14.5,2,"Shamsi to Root, 2 runs, floated up full and Root whips this away wide of long-on for a couple"

13.5,1,"Ngidi to Denly, 1 run, short of a length, 138kph/86mph and nudged through backward square towards the boundary rider"
13.4,4,"Ngidi to Denly, FOUR runs, poor ball, on the hip and that's straightforward for Denly to tuck behind square, two men back but he bisects them for a boundary"
13.3,0,"Ngidi to Denly, no run, excellent line from Ngidi, 138kph and nibbling as Denly does a square dance and is beaten"
13.2,1,"Ngidi to Root, 1 run, goes straighter, 132kph/82mph and worked through backward square leg"

11.4,0,"BE Hendricks to Denly, no run, similar line, again Denly blocks into the covers"
11.3,0,"BE Hendricks to Denly, no run, round the wicket, 136kph/84mph over the top of off, Denly defends"
11.2,2,"BE Hendricks to Denly, 2 runs, length ball on the stumps and flicked through square leg to get off the mark straight away"
11.1,7,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, OUT, skips down, done by the length - Hendricks scoops the catch in his follow-through! Trying to assert himself but Morgan departs, the ball hit the splice of the bat and just popped back to the bowler. Another self-inflicted wound for England, and this chase is just starting to wobble"
10.6,1,"Sipamla to Morgan, 1 run, short of a length, 132kph/82mph and Morgan jabs through midwicket"

10.2,1,"Sipamla to Morgan, 1 run, shortish, Morgan pulls and gets a top edge... but Ngidi can't quite get there running in! Tremendous effort from the big fast man, who hared in off the midwicket fence and threw himself bodily for it, in vain"
10.1,0,"Sipamla to Morgan, no run, back of a length on middle and off, Morgan defends"
9.6,1,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, 1 run, length ball, 136kph and Morgan squeezes a drive into the midwicket area for one - just a single off the over from Hendricks, who's come out of the Powerplay just about intact"
9.5,0,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, no run, back of a length outsdie off, tapped down square"
9.4,0,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, no run, short of a length, 134kph/83mph and Morgan jumps across to swat a mistimed pull into the covers"
9.3,0,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, no run, in-ducker, hit on the back pad, SA go up... Not given and height seems to be the main question, but de Kock reviews; what will ball-tracking say? Just shaving the top of leg stump! But that will stay as umpire's call, meaning SA do at least keep the review"
9.2,0,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, no run, short of a length, nipping to hit Morgan on the thigh pad as he hangs back"
9.1,0,"BE Hendricks to Morgan, no run, angled in with the arm, Morgan works it square"

8.2,4,"Sipamla to Morgan, FOUR runs, lovely timing, not a bad ball from Sipamla, but Morgan whips it past midwicket! Smuts perhaps isn't the most mobile in the field and he can't get down as he runs across from mid-on"

7.6,0,"BE Hendricks to Root, no run, fired in straight, 136kph/84mph and Root gets his head over the ball in defence"
7.5,7,"BE Hendricks to Roy, OUT, short and he pulls from wide of off, big top edge... swallowed by Ngidi at short fine leg! South Africa have another, aggression the undoing of both England openers once again. Roy was back and set for the short ball, but Hendricks pushed it further across him, and he was never in control of an ugly swipe"
7.4,6,"BE Hendricks to Roy, SIX runs, smashed off a length over long-on! Breezy swipe as he steps out and swings Hendricks back over the rope"

6.2,7,"Sipamla to Bairstow, OUT, bit of inward movement as Bairstow throws the hands... squirted to midwicket! Breakthrough for South Africa, and it's Sipamla who stops the rampaging Yorkshireman. Wasn't really there for the drive, YJB went after it anyway only to see the bat turn in the hands and pop a simple catch to the edge of the ring"
6.1,0,"Sipamla to Bairstow, no run, on the stumps, driven back towards mid-on without timing"
5.6,6,"BE Hendricks to Roy, SIX runs, length ball, 137kph/85mph, Roy charges out... mullers six more over long-on! Golf swing from Roy, slightly underclubbed, actually, but had enough to clear the rope. This is carnage"

4.3,0,"Sipamla to Roy, no run, comes across and taps this down into the covers"
4.2,0,"Sipamla to Roy, no run, lovely line, hits a good length and squeaks past the outside edge, Roy not quite sure whether to commit"

3.6,4,"BE Hendricks to Bairstow, FOUR runs, pitched up, 141kph/88mph outside off, belted down the ground for four more! Roy had to do a little jump at the non-striker's, nutmegged by the ball as it travelled to the rope at long-off"
3.5,0,"BE Hendricks to Bairstow, no run, good ball from Hendricks, hits the seam at 136kph and does him past the inside edge, bit of a waft from Bairstow as he looked to swing through the line"

2.5,0,"Ngidi to Bairstow, no run, shortish, tapped down into the off side"
2.4,6,"Ngidi to Bairstow, SIX runs, dug in short, Bairstow latches on - hammers a pull into the boundary boards! Three extra-crunchy boundaries in a row, as Ngidi is left shaking his head"
2.3,4,"Ngidi to Bairstow, FOUR runs, pitched up and slammed through the covers this time! Stand-and-deliver brutality"
2.2,6,"Ngidi to Bairstow, SIX runs, pongo! Picked up off the pads, and dumped on to the grass banks...! Almost a lazy flick from YJB, but all timing as he launches the ball through the thin Highveld air"
2.1,1,"Ngidi to Roy, 1 run, length in the channel, 138kph/86mph and steered down to third man playing back"
1.6,4,"BE Hendricks to Bairstow, FOUR runs, short and wide, 130kph/80mph and right off the buffet table, creamed through the covers by YJB - a really dismissive slap for four!"

1.3,1,"BE Hendricks to Roy, 1 wide, slips this one behind the pads for another extra. SA doing England's work for them, here"

0.1,1,"Ngidi to Roy, 1 wide, short and leg side, Roy flicks at it... and de Kock claims the catch, even as umpire Brathwaite signals a wide! Think that was some kidology from the SA keeper/captain"
49.6,6,"Jordan to Miller, SIX runs, quicker ball in the slot, Miller picks it up early and bludgeons it over midwicket for six more! Dire bowling from Jordan at the death, but Miller has played a lone hand to drag South Africa up to a competitive 256 for 7"
49.5,0,"Jordan to Miller, no run, yorker length, whipped out to wide long-on... realises there's no chance of a second, and belatedly decides to turn down the single"
49.4,1,"Jordan to Sipamla, 1 run, back of a length, slower ball, outside off, Sipamla looks to carve over the off side, plinking it out towards mid-off"
49.3,1,"Jordan to Miller, 1 run, yorker this time, dug out to Root who fields at cover point... and they take the single!"
49.2,0,"Jordan to Miller, no run, shuffles across again looking to hit to the short side, bit of a half-volley, 88mph/142kph and Miller can't get anything on it"
49.1,6,"Jordan to Miller, SIX runs, slower ball, shuffles across to the off side, and nails it over deep midwicket for six! Picked the slower one, moved early, and short enough to hammer through the hands of the fan in the back row and out of the ground again!"

48.5,1,"Curran to Sipamla, 1 run, low full toss, driven back at the bowler and it hits Curran! Think he's OK, quicker ball this time, burst through his hands and struck him in the chest before skewing away towards mid-off for a single"

48.3,2,"Curran to Sipamla, 2 runs, chipped over mid-off, not timed and it holds up in the outfield... the fielder gets round from long-on, and they can't get back for a third despite a poor return throw. Miller is stuck at the non-striker's end!"

47.6,4,"Jordan to Miller, FOUR runs, low full toss outside the off stump, belted towards the short boundary with the bat turning in his hands. Doesn't time it, but there's enough on it for it to reach the fence with one bounce"
47.5,1,"Jordan to Sipamla, 1 run, slower ball, back of a length, tucked off the hip down to short fine leg"
47.5,1,"Jordan to Sipamla, 1 wide, hung outside off, Sipamla flashes at thin air but it's wide enough to be called as such, much to Jordan's annoyance"
47.4,1,"Jordan to Miller, 1 run, tucked out to deep midwicket, they think about two but decide not to take Banton's arm on"
47.3,2,"Jordan to Miller, 2 runs, pushed out to deep cover, they scramble back for a second and that's Miller's half-century! Looked horrible at the start of his innings but has found some timing and become increasingly fluent, taking responsibility alongside the tail. Just the 45 balls faced"

45.4,6,"Jordan to Miller, SIX runs, slower ball, reads this one, and carts it over the short boundary at deep midwicket into the stands! Too short really, a back-of-a-length offcutter which he nails over cow corner"

45.2,1,"Jordan to Miller, 1 run, slower ball, Miller doesn't pick it at all and chips it out to extra cover on the bounce"

44.5,7,"Rashid to Miller, 1 run, OUT, googly, tucked out into the gap at straight midwicket. Rashid gives chase off his own bowling.

43.5,6,"Root to Miller, SIX runs, picks this one up, slog-sweeping it high and mighty over midwicket and out of the ground! Finally, Miller gets one out of the screws, 88m over the short side and over the back of the stand at cow corner"

42.2,7,"Rashid to Phehlukwayo, OUT, brings out the reverse, very full, struck on the pad and given! Looked dead, but Phehlukwayo reviews... didn't pick the googly, struck the front pad. Was there any glove on it? Doesn't look like it, according to UltraEdge. Ball-tracking confirms it was clipping leg stump, so we'll stay with the on-field call and Phehlukwayo has to depart!"
42.1,1,"Rashid to Miller, 1 run, tossed up, low full toss thumped out to deep cover"

35.2,0,"Ali to Phehlukwayo, no run, smothers the spin lunging forward"
35.1,1,"Ali to Miller, 1 run, length ball clipped to mid-on, the running is chaotic again but this time there's enough time for Lucky to scamper through and make his ground"
34.6,7,"Jordan to Smuts, OUT, full and straight, looks to work through midwicket where Banton makes a good diving stop... and now there's a huge mix-up, and I think Smuts has been run out at the keeper's end! Calamity for South Africa, never a run there and Miller sent Smuts back when he was halfway down. Banton's throw wasn't a direct hit, but good enough for Bairstow to gather and break the stumps"

34.4,0,"Jordan to Miller, no run, hung wide of the off stump, no shot offered"
34.3,0,"Jordan to Miller, no run, beaten, 86mph/138kph, length outside off, and a little bit of movement in is enough to burst through between bat and pad"
34.2,1,"Jordan to Smuts, 1 run, fullish on fourth stump, squeezed out into the covers via the edge"
34.1,0,"Jordan to Smuts, no run, length outside off to start, little cutter, and Smuts misses out trying to cart it into next week over cover"
33.6,0,"Ali to Miller, no run, pushed through on the stumps, defended"
33.5,1,"Ali to Smuts, 1 run, drops a touch short, stays low as Smuts wheels across the line and picks up one to deep square leg"

33.1,1,"Ali to Miller, 1 run, tickled down the ground for one"
32.6,4,"Rashid to Smuts, FOUR runs, slashed past the dive of slip! Smuts flashed and flashed hard, picks up four to third man"
32.5,0,"Rashid to Smuts, no run, turned leg side, Rashid wears the throw on his shoulder at the non-striker's as they pinch a single"

31.5,1,"Ali to Smuts, 1 run, full outside off, punched through the covers"
31.4,0,"Ali to Smuts, no run, Smuts leans out and plays a stately tap into the leg side, like a Victorian gentleman moving some luggage with his cane"

30.6,1,"Rashid to Miller, 1 run, tossed up and worked in front of midwicket, Miller is off and running, though Roy swoops and shies at one-and-a-half stumps... Just misses! Think he would have been struggling against a direct hit"
30.5,0,"Rashid to Miller, no run, flighted, Miller prods the legbreak back to the bowler"
30.4,0,"Rashid to Miller, no run, punched to extra cover coming forwards"
30.3,0,"Rashid to Miller, no run, floated up around off stump and tapped into the covers"
30.2,7,"Rashid to de Kock, OUT, oh Quinny... cleaned up having a yahoo! Rashid strikes again! Grip and spin for the leggie, who's got his snap back, from all appearances... Leg stump uprooted and South Africa's captain is dislodged. Big wicket for England, de Kock falling short of a truly match-shaping score"

29.4,4,"Ali to de Kock, FOUR runs, steps out and whips through midwicket, should be a couple to the sweeper... but Tom Curran manages to miss it as he goes for a one-handed pick-up, the ball squirming past him for four!"
29.3,0,"Ali to de Kock, no run, tossed up and swept straight to short fine leg"
29.2,1,"Ali to Smuts, 1 run, driven to mid-off, tight single here, Jordan hits the stumps directly... but he was just home, stretching for the crease!"

28.6,1,"Rashid to Smuts, 1 run, flat on the stumps and clipped square off the back foot"
28.5,1,"Rashid to de Kock, 1 run, comes forward and steers through mid-on"
28.4,2,"Rashid to de Kock, 2 runs, full, loopy and in the slot, de Kock clouts it back over the bowler's head... but it's a real plink, sticks in the turf and doesn't threaten the rope as they come back for two"
28.3,1,"Rashid to Smuts, 1 run, tossed up and punched down the ground"
28.2,6,"Rashid to Smuts, SIX runs, flighted, wide of off stump, but fetched for a flat six over cow! Maybe picked the wrong'un, big stride out and then creamed over the ropes"
28.1,0,"Rashid to Smuts, no run, tossed up on middle and off, blocked"
27.6,1,"Ali to Smuts, 1 run, tossed up and worked for a single"

26.4,0,"Rashid to Smuts, no run, googly, full outside off and Smuts plays the wrong line, beaten on the inside and Bairstow makes a juggling take... no bat involved, though"
26.3,0,"Rashid to Smuts, no run, lets this one go outside off stump"
26.2,1,"Rashid to de Kock, 1 run, on the stumps, de Kock whips it into a gap for another single"

24.4,1,"Rashid to Smuts, 1 bye, full, another wrong'un from Rashid, Smuts heaves at it and the ball skids through missing everything! Not sure he quite knew where that was going, but survives"

22.6,0,"Rashid to Smuts, no run, pushed through flatter and defended from back in the crease"
22.5,4,"Rashid to Smuts, FOUR runs, flighted, on the stumps, Smuts is down and sweeping purposefully, clobbered through backward square leg! That scoots away to the rope"

22.3,0,"Rashid to Smuts, no run, pushed through on the stumps, Smuts defends"
22.2,1,"Rashid to de Kock, 1 run, tossed up from round the wicket, worked away to the leg side"

21.6,0,"Ali to Smuts, no run, floated up full and straight, nearly over-balances looking to defend"
21.5,7,"Ali to van der Dussen, OUT, bowled him, no arguments about this one! Fired in and Rassie has gone back, trying to punch down the ground, only to have his timbers toppled. Moeen's turn to celebrate this time, and the DRS won't come into it, thank the gods"
21.4,4,"Ali to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, floated up wide of off, van der Dussen really gets hold of the reverse-sweep this time, swiped through backward point for four!"
21.3,0,"Ali to van der Dussen, no run, tossed up and worked to the on side"
21.2,0,"Ali to van der Dussen, no run, pushed through and reversed towards short third man"

20.5,0,"Rashid to van der Dussen, no run, floated up and tapped away to the off side"
20.4,0,"Rashid to van der Dussen, no run, thuds into the front pad, gone first ball! Googly again, van der Dussen missed it by a distance... and after some deliberation, Shaun Geroge's finger goes up! Looked a bit leg side, but South Africa don't have a review after Bavuma's failed use of the DRS a moment ago. But again there's a hold up, van der Dussen told not to leave the field... and then he signals for a review! England don't like this, they're saying SA don't have one left, but the umpires have called for it... and Hawk-Eye shows the ball missing leg stump! Roars from the crowd, van der Dussen gets a reprieve after all!"
20.3,7,"Rashid to Bavuma, OUT, similar line, similar result - but this is the googly, and it's given! Rashid gets his man, although Bavuma decides to review, which looks optimistic on the replays. Skidding on rather than straightening and Bavuma was all at sea trying to play it, beaten past the inside edge and Hawk-Eye has it smashing the top of middle and leg stump. There's a brief delay, with the batsman told to wait by the boundary edge - Aleem Dar, the third umpire, seemed to want another look at whether there was bat involved. But the conclusion is no, nothing on it, off you go Temba!"
20.2,0,"Rashid to Bavuma, no run, pushed through, clips the front pad, somehow misses the stumps...! Not given lbw, either, but England don't review. Well, that looked close to me, but maybe spun too much"
20.1,1,"Rashid to de Kock, 1 run, floated up and whipped off the stumps"
19.6,0,"Ali to Bavuma, no run, uses the feet, Bavuma gets to the pitch and booms a flat drive, straight to Jordan at mid-off and he has to scuttle back to his ground as the throw comes in"
19.5,0,"Ali to Bavuma, no run, floated up and defended coming across"
19.4,1,"Ali to de Kock, 1 run, drops short outside off, cut firmly but it's just a single to the man running around from deep point"

18.4,3,"Rashid to Bavuma, 3 runs, extra bounce, Bavuma cuts, slices it hard and fast past slip! Barely counts as a reaction chance for Root, though he did get a hand on it, Moeen doing well to reel the ball in in front of the rope"
18.3,0,"Rashid to Bavuma, no run, bit quicker on middle and off, Bavuma taps it to the off side and Rashid moves across to field"

16.6,6,"Jordan to de Kock, SIX runs, massive! Length ball, picked up early, and whipped off the hip with a flick over midwicket, flies into the tenth row! Brings up the fifty stand between these two"
16.5,0,"Jordan to de Kock, no run, length ball, moves in sharply off the seam as de Kock looks to flay it through cover point, and it beats the top of his bat"

16.1,1,"Jordan to Bavuma, 1 run, length outside off, uses his feet to turn it into a half-volley as he works it out to mid-on. They scamper through for a single, Curran looks to throw down the stumps but it's a very wayward through and he strikes Bavuma flush on the backside! Might be a bit of a bruise on that, but think he'll be OK"
15.6,0,"Root to de Kock, no run, fired through, nudged into the on side"
15.5,1,"Root to Bavuma, 1 run, length on the pads, tucked out to short midwicket for a sharp single"

15.1,1,"Root to de Kock, 1 run, speared in on a length, inside edged out to backward square for one"
14.6,0,"Jordan to Bavuma, no run, shimmies down the pitch looking to tuck this out to midwicket, but only manages to push it back to Jordan. He gathers in his follow-through"

11.5,0,"Root to de Kock, no run, very full, driven out to extra cover"
11.4,4,"Root to de Kock, FOUR runs, genuine edge, but it runs away past Rashid at short third man for four! Offbreak, de Kock pushed at it, nicked it, but there's no slip and it flies away"

9.6,4,"Mahmood to Bavuma, FOUR runs, half-volley on off stump, times a straight drive down the ground which races away for four! The bat turned in his hand, meaning it went through mid-on rather than mid-off"

7.5,7,"Mahmood to RR Hendricks, OUT, got him, just clips the bail on its way through!

6.3,0,"Curran to de Kock, no run, nudged out into the covers"
6.2,0,"Curran to de Kock, no run, beaten! Pitched up, de Kock's feet aren't moving well as he looks to push down the ground, and there's a bit of late swing away to fly past the edge"

3.2,0,"Mahmood to RR Hendricks, no run, outswinger on a length, 85mph/137kph, left alone. Good carry through to Bairstow"
3.1,0,"Mahmood to RR Hendricks, no run, length outside off, fenced out to cover where Banton makes a good stop to his left"

2.2,0,"Curran to de Kock, no run, back of a length, left alone with a flourish"
2.1,0,"Curran to de Kock, no run, beaten again! You know the drill, length ball pushed across him, good bounce and a hint of movement away off the seam, and past the outside edge high on the bat"

0.4,0,"Curran to de Kock, no run, pushed across him, left alone"
0.3,0,"Curran to de Kock, no run, beaten again! Little bit of nip away off the seam, de Kock looks to defend and misses it completely"

49.2,1,"Paul to PWH de Silva, 1 no ball, high full toss, Hasarangta puts it away through midwicket as Sri Lanka eke out a thrilling win, it was a no-ball anyway, so the runs off the bat won't count, but that's the highest successful chase at this ground"
49.1,7,"Paul to Sandakan, OUT, full toss, pushed to square leg, they take off for the single but a direct hit at the non striker's helps West Indies cling on by a slender thread. One to get, one wicket in hand, but importantly for Sri Lanka, the calm Hsaranga is on strike"

48.3,0,"Cottrell to Sandakan, no run, length on off, nicely behind it as he defends with great care"
48.3,1,"Cottrell to Sandakan, 1 wide, short and angled in, Sandakan can't help it along but it's a wide, regardless. Cottrell's continues to be wayward"
48.2,1,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, 1 run, full and angled in, pushes it to long-off for one"
48.1,2,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, 2 runs, full and angled in, Hasaranga caresses it to deep cover's right, they turn for the second and half way through it looks like Sandakan was going to be well short but a weak throw means he makes it back and Sri Lanka get two"
47.6,0,"Paul to Sandakan, no run, full outside off, Sandakan survives, squeezes it out into the off side"
47.5,0,"Paul to Sandakan, no run, length outside off, pushed to backward point, Hasaranga sets off the turns around to make his ground, there's a direct hit but the full length, desperate dive saves him"
47.5,1,"Paul to Sandakan, 1 wide, full and sliding down the leg side, wide called"
47.4,1,"Paul to PWH de Silva, 1 run, slower full one, walks across and pushes it to long-on for one"

46.2,4,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, FOUR runs, slower one in the slot, right under his bat and he hammers it flat and hard down the ground, one bounce and into the boundary"
46.1,1,"Cottrell to Sandakan, 1 run, full an angling away, Sandakan squeezes it away off a thick outside edge to third-man for one"
45.6,1,"Paul to Sandakan, 1 leg bye, length and angled in, Sandakan can't get any bat on it but a leg bye to fine leg will do just as well"
45.5,1,"Paul to PWH de Silva, 1 run, slower ball on off, pushed into the covers for one"
45.4,1,"Paul to Sandakan, 1 run, full around off, comes forward to drive but gets an inside edge that goes down to fine leg after narrowly evading the stumps"
45.3,7,"Paul to Udana, OUT, edged and taken, Udana goes for a duck! Keemo Paul hasn't had the best day but produces a crucial wicket with a length ball that climbed on to Udana who had a little poke at it to offer Shai Hope his fourth catch of the afternoon"

42.5,0,"Joseph to Udana, no run, short and quick, ducks under it"
42.4,7,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, OUT, short one on middle, Perera pulls hard but pulls uppishly and holes out to deep midwicket! Another batsman throws his wicket away in a rush of  blood and West Indies are allowed back into the game again. It was a good, counter-attacking knock but with the equation heavily in his team's favour all he had to do was hold his nerve, but he didn't and the match is back in the balance"
42.3,2,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, full on the pads, Perera flicks it uppishly to deep square leg's right for a couple"
42.2,0,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, no run, full on middle and leg, defended back to the bowler"

40.5,4,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, Walsh goes short, Perera hangs back, opens the face and gives it direction bisecting short third and point"
40.4,0,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, no run, length on middle and leg, defended"
40.3,2,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, down the wicket, drilled to cover's right and Pollard nearly plucks it with a dive to his right, can't hang on as Perera gets two"
40.2,0,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, no run, quicker one on middle, defended"
40.1,6,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, SIX runs, Perera continues to play with abandon, goes down the track, gets to the pitch and launches Walsh over the long-on fence"
39.6,3,"Paul to NLTC Perera, 3 runs, full and wide of off stump. Thisara brings his bat down and squirts this square on the offside, powerfully enough to beat point this time. Third man gives chase and cuts it off, but a fumble on the boundary allows a third."
39.5,0,"Paul to NLTC Perera, no run, back of a length, outside off. Thisara bunts this square into the offside, but finds a fielder"
39.4,1,"Paul to PWH de Silva, 1 run, this is short again, but well outside off. He opens the face again and this time beats the point fielder."
39.3,6,"Paul to PWH de Silva, SIX runs, woah, where's that come from? This is short -chest high - and at the body from Paul. Hasaranga gets inside the line beautifully and pulls that nonchalantly over backward square leg for six. That's way into the stand! Runs keep coming despite the wickets."
39.2,0,"Paul to PWH de Silva, no run, short of a length outside off stump. Hasaranga opens the face and tries to get it fine of point, but can't beat the fielder. They think about the run but abort it early enough for them to get back."
39.1,1,"Paul to NLTC Perera, 1 run, length ball, just outside off stump. Thisara gets on the back foot and bludgeons this down to long on."
38.6,0,"Walsh to PWH de Silva, no run, length ball, turning in. Pushed to mid on."
38.5,4,"Walsh to PWH de Silva, FOUR runs, this is a tossed up googly, wide of off stump. Hasaranga seems to pick it and he throws his bat at it. Gets a good enough connection to beat point, and bisect the converging sweeper and third man on the boundary."
38.4,0,"Walsh to PWH de Silva, no run, flatter and shorter. Poked into the offside again."
38.3,0,"Walsh to PWH de Silva, no run, full and fired in on around off stump. Just pushed into the offside."
38.2,1,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, 1 run, runs at Walsh Jr. this time, and tries to hit him into the neighbouring galaxy. Gets a thick outside edge that floats over cover to the offside sweeper instead."
38.1,0,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, no run, ooof, he's almost edged this. Walsh straightens one after pitching outside off. Perera wants to run this off the face, but he misses. That wasn't far from the edge."
37.6,0,"Paul to PWH de Silva, no run, short of a length, into the body, Defended into the legside."
37.5,0,"Paul to PWH de Silva, no run, shortish, outside off stump. Left alone by the new batsman Hasaranga."
37.4,7,"Paul to MDKJ Perera, OUT, and that's not smart batting from Kusal Perera.  Gets a short ball, he waits back for it and pulls it in the air, but Darren Bravo, at deep midwicket, is all over this one. He surges forward as the ball drops on him, and puts in a dive to snatch the ball inches from the ground. Makes sure he clings to it even as his elbows hit the ground. Some poor batting, and excellent catching."
37.3,3,"Paul to NLTC Perera, 3 runs, length on the stumps, and this is good batting from Thisara. Turns it around the corner, and there's a chase on for short fine leg and the legside sweeper. They end up running three."
37.2,4,"Paul to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, that's very sweetly timed. Low full toss on the toes. Thisara whips this through midwicket and connects nicely enough to beat the legside sweeper."
37.1,1,"Paul to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, length outside off stump. KJP drives this between cover and mid off for one."
36.6,0,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, no run, a little slower this time, straightening on the stumps. Thisara clips it to midwicket."
36.5,0,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, no run, full and fast on the toes. Thisara digs out what is essentially a yorker."
36.5,1,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, 1 wide, fired full and down leg."
36.4,4,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, similar ball, just a touch wider, and Thisara connects this time, bludgeoning it square of cover, all the way to the boundary."
36.3,0,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, no run, flat, fast slider. Thisara Perera tires to crunch that through off, but misses."
36.2,1,"Walsh to NLTC Perera, 1 run, flatter and on the stumps, turned behind square on the legside"
36.1,7,"Walsh to DM de Silva, OUT, Another one goes! Just when SL start to look mildly comfortable, they do something to let West Indies back in. DdeS is down the pitch to Walsh Jr. but doesn't get anywhere near the pitch of the ball. Goes through with the lofted straight drive anyway, and it hangs in the air. Keemo Paul makes some serious ground, running in from long off, to get himself under this one, and completes the catch with a slide. Wonderful athleticism."
35.6,1,"Holder to DM de Silva, 1 run, length, on the stumps. Could be a slower one. DdeS waits for it and knocks it into space on the legside infield to get a single"
35.5,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, another short of a length ball into the midriff. Gets his eyes over this one and defends."
35.4,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, tries to turn this to leg, but gets a leading edge that falls into space in the cover area"
35.3,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, short ball into the body again, and defended"
35.2,4,"Holder to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, top edge for four. Looked like he wanted to fetch that short ball from way outside off stump and hit it through midwicket. Holder's extra bounce, though, means he can't play this as he wants. Gets a thick top edge over the keeper."
35.1,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, short ball on the hips, turned around the corner for one"
34.6,1,"Walsh to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, on the stumps, worked to deep square leg for another single"
34.5,2,"Walsh to MDKJ Perera, 2 runs, another short-ish delivery, straightening outside off stump. Kusal Perera cuts this in front of square. Gets it far enough away from the sweeper cover to get himself a couple."
34.4,1,"Walsh to DM de Silva, 1 run, drops it a little short. He's been flat all over. DdeS clips this to the legside sweeper for an easy one."
34.3,1,"Walsh to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, flat again, not a lot of turn, and straightening on the stumps. KJP hits with the turn and gets a single to midwciket"
34.2,1,"Walsh to DM de Silva, 1 run, flatter and fired in on the stumps. DdeS pushes it into space towards midwicket."
34.1,1,"Walsh to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, starts off with a googly, which KJP picks. Turns it behind square on the legside"
33.6,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, a little inward movement off the seam again. This time DdeS gets an inside edge on to pad."
33.5,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, length ball, jagging in slightly, outside off. DdeS plays it into the offside infield"
33.4,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, up into the waist area again from Holder. KJP tucks it straight of square leg for one."
33.3,1,"Holder to DM de Silva, 1 run, another sharp single. This short of a length ball was punched very close to point, but DdeS has called early and makes his ground at the non-striker's end as the throw comes in"
33.2,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, fuller again, and just outside off. KJP check drives this to mid off, but there's no power in the shot - intentionally - and they can sprint a single"
33.1,0,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, no run, length, angled into middle stump. KJP turns it around the corner but short fine leg is on to it quickly."
32.6,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, length on the stumps, clipped to short midwicket"
32.5,4,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, short again, on the stumps again, this time DdeS is on the back foot, waiting for it. Hits it just above Pollard's reach at short midwicket, and it skips to the boundary"
32.4,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, short and into the body, defended again with a little hop"
32.3,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, fuller and on the stumps. Defended down the pitch."
32.2,1,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, slower ball, on the pads. I think KJP misses with his prod, and they run a legbye. There's a half-hearted appeal as well, but that's going down leg probably."
32.1,0,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, no run, full and on the stumps, drilled straight to mid on"
31.6,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, short and wide, DdeS attempts an unconvincing cut - doesn't really commit to the shot. As a result, he misses."
31.5,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, shortish, and a little wide. KJP plays a rapid cut shot. Doesn't quite connect as he wants, but beats point for a single."
31.4,1,"Holder to DM de Silva, 1 run, shortish and into the body, pulled away firmly to fine leg"
31.4,1,"Holder to DM de Silva, 1 wide, short, but way too short. Flies high over DDeS' head and a wide is signalled."
31.3,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, back of a length on off stump. Defended under the eyes."
31.2,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, length ball on off stump. Pushed towards the covers, and it's far enough away from the fielder there to enable a single."
31.1,1,"Holder to DM de Silva, 1 run, starts off with a ball into Dhananjaya's ribs. He rides the bounce again, and fends it towards square leg. It's a gap so they can take one."
30.6,0,"Joseph to MDKJ Perera, no run, fuller, and on the stumps. KJP turns this towards leg but can't beat midwicket."
30.5,0,"Joseph to MDKJ Perera, no run, short of a length, straightening a touch off the seam, and it hits KJP in the thigh guard. Dribbles away to leg."
30.4,1,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 1 run, fuller delivery on the pad, leans over and flicks it to deep square leg where the fielder has a bit of work to do. De Silva wants the second but KJP not into it."
30.3,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, length ball on the stumps, bunts this into the legside, where Pollard fields it at midwicket."
30.2,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, another one up at the chest. A little hop from Dhananjaya this time as he plays it down, under his eyes"
30.1,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, short ball, chest high. Dhananjaya is up on his tiptoes riding this nicely. Deflects it towards point."
29.6,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, banged in half way and around his hip, gets on top of it and nudges it towards square leg for one"
29.5,1,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, full and angled in tickled to short fine leg's right for one"
29.4,0,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, no run, length on off, better line, Perera still opens the face and steers it to backward point's left"
29.3,0,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, no run, length outside off, Perera guides it straight to backward point, would have liked to have done more with that"
29.3,1,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, 1 wide, slower one, full and sliding down the leg side"
29.2,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, length and angled across, steered to third-man"
29.1,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, short and angled away, gets on top of it as he defends to point"
28.6,1,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 1 run, length and on the pads, tucked away to deep square leg to get off the mark"
28.5,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, length around off, hangs back and defends. Will he throw a full, wide one to him as well?"
28.5,1,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 1 wide, length and slides way down the leg side, good take from Hope diving to his left"
28.4,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, length around off, Dhanajaya also likes hanging back, on his toes as he defends a quick one"
28.3,7,"Joseph to Mathews, OUT, full and swinging away a touch, Mathews follows it with his hands and there's a massive appeal as he's seemingly beaten. There was a noise but could have been bat hitting ground, West Indies review, however. And it's an excellent review, replay confirms that it took the bottom edge and Joseph, who has been quite wayward strikes again as West Indies continue to chip away. This is beautifully poised as the players take drinks"
28.2,4,"Joseph to Mathews, FOUR runs, full, fast and angled in but slides down the leg side, Mathews tickles it fine and earns four"
28.1,0,"Joseph to Mathews, no run, length around off, Mathews likes to hang back, defends from his comfort zone"
27.6,1,"Cottrell to Mathews, 1 run, length on the pads, Mathews nudged it to the leg side after going deep in his crease as they set off for a single, could have been close with a direct hit at the non striker's but the fielder misses"
27.5,1,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, length and angled in, tucked away through square leg for one"
27.4,4,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, short and wide, where Perera likes it and hammers a cut shot past point's right for four"
27.3,4,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, slower one, angled in, tickled fine past the short fine leg's right, the fielder chases and gets there but is a little lazy to bend and it trickles into the boundary"
27.2,0,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, no run, shorter and angled in, tucked away to square leg"
27.1,0,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, no run, length on middle, stands tall and defends"
27.1,1,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, 1 wide, length and angled in, slides down the leg side"
26.6,7,"Walsh to Mendis, OUT, classic legspinner's dismissal, to a full toss! How often have we seen this happen? A juicy full toss around off asking to be hit, but instead of the controlled option of going through the off side, Mendis looks to drag it over the leg side and doesn't make good enough contact offering a simple catch to mid-on and West Indies, who looked down and out, a lifeline"
26.5,0,"Walsh to Mendis, no run, full outside off, comes forward and defends"
26.4,4,"Walsh to Mendis, FOUR runs, freebie, full toss outside off, Mendis just leans into it and gives it direction through extra cover, beats the sweeper to his right"
26.3,1,"Walsh to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, length on middle, Perera looks to take him on, sweeps it along the ground to deep square leg"

25.5,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, "
25.4,6,"Chase to Mendis, SIX runs, breaks the shackles in style! Tossed up around middle, Mendis skips down and lofts him over his head making great connection as he clears the staight boundary with ease"
25.3,1,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, tossed up around off, pushed to long-off for one"
25.2,4,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, full around off and Perera brings out the reverse sweep, makes good connection, bisecting short third man and point even though it was aerial"
25.1,0,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, no run, full and angled in, pushed to midwicket"
24.6,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, another really full one outside off, squeezed out into the off side"

The keeper whipped off the bails and they have gone to the third-umpire to check whether Mendis dragged his backfoot out. No problem there, the backfoot was grounded and never dragged out"
23.5,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, a little short, Mendis goes back and defends to midwicket"
23.4,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, tossed up around off, Mendis pushes it to midwicket with the spin"
23.3,1,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, short outside off, cut hard but straight to cover-point who fumbles and allows one"
23.2,0,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, no run, full on off, defended"
23.1,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, a little short and angled in, Mendis helps it along to deep backward square leg for one"
22.6,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, full and angled in, Mendis flicks it neatly off his pads to deep square leg for one"
22.5,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, full and tailing in a touch, Mendis was falling over a little as he flicked that to midwicket"
22.4,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, length on the stumps this time, opens up a little and defends to the leg side"
22.3,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, length around off, it's a line that troubles most batsmen but Mendis in particular, who is caught on the crease as it leaves him a touch and beats the bat"
22.2,1,"Joseph to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, length on the pads, tucked away to square leg for one"
22.1,0,"Joseph to MDKJ Perera, no run, length angled across, Perera swings wildly across the line and misses as the ball goes under his bat"
21.6,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, full on middle, pushed to midwicket"
21.5,1,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, shorter and wider outside off, Perera cuts and gets a single as Keemo Paul at point lets it through"
21.4,0,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, no run, tossed up on off, driven to cover"
21.3,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, full around off, skips down, gets to the pitch and works it with the spin through midwicket"

20.4,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, length around off, hurries on as he opens the face and steers it to third-man"
20.3,4,"Joseph to Mendis, FOUR runs, full outside off, Mendis leans into it confidently and caresses it through the covers to get off the mark in style"
20.2,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, "
20.1,7,"Joseph to Fernando, OUT, strangle down the leg side? Yes, and that's terribly unlucky for Avishka Fernando who played a superb knock and looked good for a lot more than fifty. It was angled in, he instinctively looked to glance it fine but only managed a thin edge down the leg to Shai Hope as Joseph keeps West Indies in the hunt with a timely strike"
19.6,0,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, no run, fullish, and on off stump. KJP opens the face again, but this time there's not a lot of power in the shot and point stops the single."
19.5,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, into the waist from Holder. Avishka just bunts this into the legside infield, where there is plenty of space, and jogs through for the single that takes him to 50. Has played some electric strokes."
19.4,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, tighter into the stumps from Holder this time. KJP opens the face and squirts it past point for a single"
19.3,4,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, full again, wide again, KJP steps out and throws himself into that drive again. This time he hits it slightly squarer and pierces that gap. The ball scorches its way to the boundary between mid off and cover."
19.2,0,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, no run, fuller and wider and KJP launches this down the ground, getting a pretty good connection. Straight to mid off though."
19.1,0,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, no run, length ball pitching on about middle, and angling across. KJP just plays this back to the bowler."
18.6,1,"Paul to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, into the hips, turned down to fine leg for a single"
18.5,0,"Paul to MDKJ Perera, no run, fuller, and outside off stump. KJP goes for a big shot down the ground, but collects only fresh aire"
18.4,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, back of a length on the body again from Paul. Avishka turns it to square leg."
18.3,1,"Paul to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, fullish and on the pads, works this towards midwicket to get off the mark"
18.2,0,"Paul to MDKJ Perera, no run, length ball on the stumps. Defends his first delivery."
18.1,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, Length on the stumps, tucked away to deep square leg."
17.6,7,"Holder to Karunaratne, OUT, no doubts this time. This was tighter into the stumps, and again Karunaratne is playing a shot, pushing away from his body, trying to find the gap between cover and point. Holder's height and the little extra bounce that he's getting, though, has troubled him all over, and this is no exception. This time he gets a discernible edge through. Hope takes the ball above his head, and Holder has the breakthrough! He's understandably ecstatic."
17.5,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, given out caught behind and Karunaratne immediately reviews. Again its back of a length, and again its wide of off stump. Karunaratne plays that big cut again, and doesn't connect like he wants to flies through to the keeper. Both Hope and Holder are up in a huge appeal, though, and after a couple of seconds, the umpire gives this out. No wonder Karunaratne reviewed straight away. Ultraedge suggests he didn't touch it."
17.4,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, back of a length outside off. Dimuth punches it to cover."
17.3,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, length ball, takes off a little off the deck. It's wide of the stumps, so Karunaratne tries to flay this through the offside, but the extra bounce has taken it over his shot."
17.2,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, manages to connect nicely this time, and does succeed in getting it to third man"
17.1,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, short of a length ball on the stumps, Avishka leans back and tries to deflect this towards third man, but only gets an under edge. It passes over the stumps and drops short of the keeper though."
16.6,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, length on the stumps again, clipped to the deep midwicket fielder"
16.5,0,"Paul to Fernando, no run, length on the pads, turned straight to square leg"
16.4,2,"Paul to Fernando, 2 leg byes, length ball, on the stumps, and Avishka plays a weird on drive and misses. It hits him on the thigh guard and Paul appeals, but that's probably too high and sliding down. They jog leg byes"
16.3,1,"Paul to Karunaratne, 1 run, driven towards deep cover"
16.2,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, thigh-high delivery on the stumps. He clips this square on the legside and gets it between midwicket and square leg for one."
16.1,0,"Paul to Fernando, no run, length ball on the stumps, Avishka turns the bat slightly and pushes it to midwicket"
15.6,4,"Holder to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, that's lovely! In between the plays and misses, there have been some sumptuous pieces of timing from Dimuth as well. This is full and on about off stump. He just leans into a checked on-drive, and makes such a sweet connection that a diving mid on can't touch it. He brings up his fifth career fifty with that."
15.5,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, length ball angled across again. Dimuth again offers a shot - not a very expansive one - and misses once more"
15.4,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, length ball on the stumps, Dimuth just plays this back down the pitch"
15.3,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, short and on the stumps. Avishka has made room though, and he's opened his bat to hit this backward of point for a single."
15.2,1,"Holder to Karunaratne, 1 run, a streaky single down to third man brings up SL's 100. Again the ball is wide and angled across him. Again he plays an expansive drive. The outside edge flies down to third man."
15.1,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, length ball, angled across Dimuth. He tries to hit it through the covers but plays and misses."
14.6,1,"Paul to Karunaratne, 1 run, short of a length outside off. Karunaratne uses the angle to his advantage and helps it on its way towards third man by opening the face."
14.5,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, short of a length, and Avishka goes back to bunt this into the midwicket region, where there's plenty of space"
14.4,1,"Paul to Karunaratne, 1 run, floated up just wide of off stump, Karunaratne tries to clip this hard through midwicket. Hits it straight to midwicket, but a fumble allows the single"
14.3,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, full and on the stumps again, clipped to the deep midwicket region for a single"
14.2,0,"Paul to Fernando, no run, length ball on the pads, defended straight to Pollard at short midwicket"
14.1,1,"Paul to Karunaratne, 1 run, length ball outside off, single down to long off"
13.6,1,"Chase to Karunaratne, 1 run, yet another close call for Dimuth! He comes down the track and tries to loft this back over Chase's head. Doesn't quite get to the pitch though, and although he hits it hard, doesn't get the elevation. Chase has to react quickly and almost gets both hands to the ball, but can't hold on. Only a half-chance really. But WI have had a few of those."
13.5,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, flat and on middle stump, swept nicely this time to deep square"
13.4,1,"Chase to Karunaratne, 1 run, another one floated up to the toes. Driven to long on"
13.3,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, fired in full outside off, driven to long off for one"
13.2,0,"Chase to Fernando, no run, shorter, and flatter, turning into off stump. Avishka tries to sweep but doesn't connect very well"
13.1,1,"Chase to Karunaratne, 1 run, floated up into the pads, clipped towards square leg for a single"
12.6,1,"Joseph to Karunaratne, 1 run, closer to the stumps, and slightly short. Dimuth squeezes it to third man, who's standing pretty square."
12.5,0,"Joseph to Karunaratne, no run, wider of the stumps now, and Dimuth tries to cut. But he misses."
12.4,0,"Joseph to Karunaratne, no run, back of a length again, but a little fuller than the last one. Karunaratne pulls once more, but can only hit it with the under edge, and he doesn't beat midwicket"
12.3,4,"Joseph to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, Karunaratne has pulled beautifully today. Joseph drops short, Karunaratne rocks back, and nails it smoothly through midwicket"
12.2,0,"Joseph to Karunaratne, no run, short of a length, angled across Karunaratne. He cuts it straight to backward point."
12.1,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, back of a length outside off stump, runs this off the face of the bat to third man"
11.6,0,"Chase to Karunaratne, no run, West Indies have gone for the review, after the umpire ruled this not out. It's very close, I feel. So this is a gentle offbreak, pitching around middle, and straightening. Chase is coming around the wicket for Karunaratne, so the thing that could save the batsman is that the angle could be taking it down leg. In the end, that's exactly what saves him. The projection says umpires call on the impact with leg stump. Karunaratne survives another close one."
11.5,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, flatter and pitched outside off stump, turning ever so slightly, Avishka gets it down to long on again"
11.4,1,"Chase to Karunaratne, 1 run, shortish, and outside the off stump, Dimuth rocks back and cuts it towards the sweeper"
11.3,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, floated up, driven to long on for one"
11.2,0,"Chase to Fernando, no run, fired into the legs, he pushes this into the legside and thinks about the single, but the fielders are in too close"
11.1,1,"Chase to Karunaratne, 1 run, floated up, driven to mid off for a single"
10.6,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, length ball on the stumps, Avishka tries to slog this to leg, but gets and inside edge into his pads"
10.5,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, back of a length, on about off stump this time. Again Avishka opens the face and can't beat point."
10.4,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, into the midriff area again from Alzarri. Avishka just fends it away and it falls near his feet."
10.4,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 wide, down the legside"
10.3,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, "
10.2,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, full, on the stumps, pushed into the legside"
10.1,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, Short ball, at the body. Avishka tries to slam this cross-batted over the legside but mishits it and can only hit it to mid on with not a lot of power"

9.6,4,"Chase to Fernando, 4 wides, full and thrown down the leg side, perhaps anticipating the charge, the batsman lets it through, it beats the keeper as they come through for three"
9.5,6,"Chase to Fernando, SIX runs, flatter one on middle and off and Fernando extends his arms, goes through the line and up and over the bowler's head to the safest part of the ground, clears the ropes comfortably"
9.4,1,"Chase to Karunaratne, 1 run, short this time and Dimuth punches it into the off side but can't pierce the field"

8.5,4,"Joseph to Karunaratne, FOUR runs, full outside off, West Indies continue feed them freebies, Dimuth pushes it with a straight bat without trying to hit it too hard and beats mid-off for four"
8.4,0,"Joseph to Karunaratne, no run, quick one, length on middle, Dimuth is hurried for pace as he misses the flick"
8.3,0,"Joseph to Karunaratne, no run, length outside off, Dimuth hangs back to defends this as it keeps a touch low"
8.2,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, length and angled in this time, Fernando controls the pull along the ground to deep square leg for one"

6.2,4,"Paul to Fernando, FOUR runs, another gift outside off, Fernando cuts it hard past point for four"

4.4,3,"Cottrell to Karunaratne, 3 runs, length and angling in, Dimuth is early into flick again as it seems to hold in the surface, balloons just over Darren Bravo at square leg, who seemed to have got his finger tips to it"

3.6,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, short and wide this time, lures Dimuth into another poke and beats the bat again. This one, to be honest, was a freebie"

41.6,7,"Udana to Pollard, OUT, short one, it's quick one, Pollard goes for the pull but is late on it, top edges it high in the air towards fine leg where Sandakan takes a tumbling catch after not looking entirely comfortable under it, probably unsure where the line was, but hangs on.. Massive, massive boost for Sri Lanka"
41.5,1,"Udana to Hope, 1 run, length on the pads, tickles it to fine-leg to move to 99"

39.4,1,"Udana to Pollard, 1 run, bouncer first up! Surprises Pollard a bit to. He arches his back, takes his eyes off, and seems to only get a glove to it. It dribbles away on the legside"
39.3,7,"Udana to Pooran, OUT, The slower ball has done it for Udana! Back of the hand again, with a little bit of side spin to boot. Pooran was waiting forever for this one, which pitched on a length outside off stump. He tried to lift it over cover, but could only hit it low to the fielder. No power in that shot.

39.1,1,"Udana to Pooran, 1 run, full toss on the pads. Pooran can only get this slightly wide of midwicket, who dives. A fumble allows a single."
39.1,1,"Udana to Pooran, 1 wide, back of the hand slower ball, but a badly misdirected one. Dribbles away past the tram lines on the offside and that's a clear wide."
38.6,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, gets the reverse-sweep out, but this ball is flat and he doesn't quite connect as he wants to. Gets it into the gap around square leg though, and takes a single to retain strike."

38.4,0,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, no run, full and on the stumps, driven to mid on"

35.6,7,"Pradeep to Chase, OUT, timber! Pradeep has deserved that. Though it's not a particularly great ball that gets him the wicket. This is a length ball, pushed through outside off stump. Chase tries to smack this over the top of the offside infield, but can only get an inside edge that ricochets on to middle stump. A little relief for SL, just as it looked like these two were ready to accelerate."
35.5,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, driven to mid off."

35.1,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, short ball, angled in slightly. Hope tries to turn this into the legside off his hip, but the ball lobs into the air off his leading edge. The fielder at short cover can't do much though, as it floats over his head. Pradeep is keeled over in frustration. The batsmen take one."

33.3,4,"Pradeep to Chase, FOUR runs, didn't quite get hold of that, but made enough of a connection to get a boundary. This is short of a length and quite wide of off stump, but Chase fetched it with a cross batted slog, and got it aerially towards the midwicket boundary. Not the nicest looking boundary, but he knew he was hitting into space"
33.2,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, rib high, bouncer. Hope gets nicely inside the line and pulls this to deep square leg"

9.4,2,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 2 runs, fuller and angling in, Hope flicks it through square leg for a couple"
9.3,1,"NLTC Perera to Bravo, 1 leg bye, length and angled in this time, Bravo misses the flick as it bounces a bit extra and takes the thigh pad before trickling into the leg side as they come through for one"
9.2,0,"NLTC Perera to Bravo, no run, length outside off, Bravo punches it wide of mid-off on the up, but the timing isn't great and the fielder gets around to it to his right and keeps him on strike"
9.1,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, length outside off, bit of width, Hope opens the face and guides it down to third-man for one"
8.6,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, length outside off, there was a bit of width but Bravo isn't lured into fishing at it, shoulders arms"

8.4,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, pulls his length back, closer to off, Bravo defends back to the bowler"
8.3,4,"Udana to Bravo, FOUR runs, overpitched outside off, hint of width and all Bravo does is give it direction, finds the gap between point and cover and the timing is excellent as well"
8.2,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, length outside off, opens the face as he defends into the cover region"
8.1,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, length outside off, Bravo hangs back and defends"

6.1,1,"Pradeep to Bravo, 1 run, nice and full outside off, Bravo drives on the up but gets a thick outside edge past point's right and down to third-man for one, but that should encourage Pradeep"

3.2,7,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, OUT, cleaned him up! The length was the key, full enough but not a driving length, he pushed at it with his hands way in front leaving a gap between bat and pad, which the nip back in from Perera found its way through to crash into the stumps"

0.2,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, dream start for Pradeep as he pins Hope in front! Hope reviews, however. It's a legal delivery, full and angling in again, looks a bit leg side, Hope missed the flick, there was no bat, but ball-tracking shows it would have missed leg stump, so Hope survives. He needs to be careful to not fall over in this manner"
0.1,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, full and angling in, no away movement but excellent length, Hope pushes at it and gets a thick inside edge towards midwicket"
39.1,7,"Sandakan to Allen, OUT, picks out long-on. It's all over. Sri Lanka win by 162 runs and seal the series 2-0. This was tossed up on the stumps, Allen made room and connected well with the lofted on-drive, but there was a fielder right there and he hit it straight to him. He didn't have much option, other than trying to hit out."
38.6,7,"Pradeep to Joseph, OUT, off stump goes for a walk. Took just three balls post resumption to get another one. Yorker on off, too good for a tailender. The stumps were out of the ground before his bat had come down properly almost"
38.5,0,"Pradeep to Joseph, no run, bouncer, goes over his left shoulder. He goes for the pull but misses."
38.4,0,"Pradeep to Joseph, no run, yorker on middle and off, tailing in late first up. Driven off the toe-end back to the bowler"
38.3,7,"Pradeep to Paul, OUT, Pradeep outsmarts him. These batsmen were clearly chancing their arm, and he bowls a beautiful back of the hand slower ball, which floats up to almost yorker length. Paul is playing a mighty heave over the legside, but is through the shot early, and the ball goes clattering into the stumps."
38.2,4,"Pradeep to Paul, FOUR runs, short again, and wide of off stump, but Paul fetches that and bashes it over midwicket for four"
38.1,0,"Pradeep to Paul, no run, shortish ball on off stump. Paul tries to defend and gets a thick inside edge onto thigh pad"
37.6,6,"Sandakan to Allen, SIX runs, Allen's going to have some fun! This is tossed up, overpitched really, and Allen makes room, clears the front leg, and wallops this high over wide long off for the first six of the match!"
37.5,0,"Sandakan to Allen, no run, floated up, defended into the offside"
37.4,1,"Sandakan to Paul, 1 run, flatter, faster, turning in from middle stump. Paul goes back and clips this away towards midwicket"
37.3,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, flighted beautifully, getting Paul to commit to the shot, before the ball dips, grips and turns to beat the shot and strike him in front of middle and off. Huge appeal and it's turned down. But they are reviewing it. Is it turning too much and missing leg though? There's no inside edge on to pad, so it's all down to ball tracking, which is taking a while. As suspected, it's turning too far, and missing the stumps. Sri Lanka lose their review."
37.2,1,"Sandakan to Allen, 1 run, similar floated up ball, but tighter into the stumps. Drilled to mid off."
37.2,5,"Sandakan to Allen, (no ball) FOUR runs, floated up and pitched wide. Allen strides out and slams that through the covers. Gets a free hit next ball as it's a no-ball as well."

36.6,1,"Pradeep to Allen, 1 run, short and wide, but I think that's a slower ball. Allen slams that away to the sweeper cover"
36.5,0,"Pradeep to Allen, no run, another bouncer, this time just outside off stump. Allen runs at this ball and tries another hook. Again no chance of a connection."
36.4,0,"Pradeep to Allen, no run, slower ball, length on the stumps. Allen spots it and just keeps it out"
36.3,0,"Pradeep to Allen, no run, bouncer, seemed pretty slippery. Surprises Allen a bit and he offers a half-hearted hook that never really had a chance of connecting"
36.2,0,"Pradeep to Allen, no run, full on off stump, almost a yorker. Crunched to cover."
36.1,4,"Pradeep to Allen, FOUR runs, Shortish ball to begin with, and Allen is back on his heels very quickly, cracking that through midwicket for four with a pull shot"
35.6,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, fuller, wider of off stump. Paul just knocks this back to Sandakan."
35.5,2,"Sandakan to Paul, 2 runs, shortish, turning away - googly. Paul goes back and swats this down the ground past the bowler"
35.4,1,"Sandakan to Allen, 1 run, floated up on leg stump, swept to fine leg"
35.3,0,"Sandakan to Allen, no run, floated up wide of the stumps, just bunted to cover"
35.2,1,"Sandakan to Paul, 1 run, flatter on the stumps, turned towards midwicket"
35.1,7,"Sandakan to Pooran, OUT, that's it for Pooran. Mathews again, with a sublime piece of fielding. This is slowed down from Sandakan, and Pooran is into the sweep too early, and the ball takes the top edge and floats towards midwicket. Mathews, at square leg, has a little bit of time as it hangs in the air, but a lot of ground to make up as well. Sprints full tilt to his right, then at the last moment kicks up his heels and puts in a dive to get his hands on this. Fantastic catch, and you think West Indies' last real hope may have gone"
35.1,1,"Sandakan to Pooran, 1 wide, waaay down the legside. Kusal Perera just manages to get a pad behind it."
34.6,0,"PWH de Silva to Paul, no run, shorter, turning away, and just hit back to the bowler once more"
34.5,0,"PWH de Silva to Paul, no run, full toss, but Paul can't make much of it, partly because it was fired in. Driven back to the bowler."

34.3,0,"PWH de Silva to Paul, no run, legbreak, floated up, defended"
34.2,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, short ball, but Pooran had committed to the reverse sweep, and he can't get a lot of power into it. Just hits it to deep square leg for one"
34.1,0,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, no run, fullish, fired in, struck back to the bowler"
33.6,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, fullish delivery, turned straight of midwicket for a single"
33.5,2,"Sandakan to Paul, 2 runs, similar ball, and similar shot, except Paul connects this time. Sweeper cover has work to do"
33.4,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, googly. Shortish ball, and Paul goes on to the back foot and tries to crack that away to the off side. Keeps a bit low, though and he misses"
33.3,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, floated wide again, and Paul tries to drive this to long off. Inside edge, though, and it dribbles back to the bowler"
33.2,4,"Sandakan to Paul, FOUR runs, launches into that one. Sandakan pitching a bit wide again, and letting Paul free his shoulders. That's a  slog/sweep across the line, and a four to cow corner"
33.1,2,"Sandakan to Paul, 2 runs, floated wide, and Paul frees his arms and slaps this to the sweeper cover. Gets two for that"
32.6,1,"PWH de Silva to Paul, 1 run, floated up well outside off stump. Paul knocks this down to long off"
32.5,4,"PWH de Silva to Paul, FOUR runs, dropped short, and Paul is quickly dropping his weight back to crash that behind deep square leg for four"
32.4,0,"PWH de Silva to Paul, no run, flatter and on off stump. Just defended."
32.3,0,"PWH de Silva to Paul, no run, another googly, and a decent appeal. He's getting these googlies to turn. It's hit Paul on the pad, but that's probably sliding down leg."
32.2,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, fuller, on the stumps, reverse swept out to deep point"
32.1,0,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, no run, was that a slider? Shortish and skidding on. Pooran goes back to cut that through the offside but misses"
31.6,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, another googly, turning this time. Paul goes back and tries to reach for it, but misses it"
31.5,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, full and fired in. Paul tries to sweep and gets a half decent connection, fetching it from well outside off. But it's straight to short midwicket again"
31.4,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, another googly, this is straighter, and not turning much. Paul whips this straight to short midwicket"
31.3,0,"Sandakan to Paul, no run, googly I think, pitched way outside off stump and turning away. Paul bunts this away on the offside"

31.1,4,"Sandakan to Pooran, FOUR runs, tossed up on offstump, the stock ball. Pooran gets the big reverse sweep out though, and makes an excellent connection. It scorches past short third man and to the boundary."
30.6,0,"PWH de Silva to Paul, no run, googly to start with, but Paul is expecting it. Just gets a stride out and pushes it back in the direction it came"
30.5,7,"PWH de Silva to Holder, OUT, another googly, another wicket. Holder had no idea about that one. This is shorter than the one to Pollard. Holder is playing for the legbreak and is nowhere near this ball as it spins in between bat and pad and clatters into the stumps. West Indies in a proper nosedive now. Sri Lanka's wristspinners in full bamboozle mode."
30.4,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, shorter, and turning in. Pooran gets on the back foot and carves it out to deep cover."
30.3,0,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, no run, tossed up, very full. Pooran drives to short cover."

29.2,0,"Sandakan to Pooran, no run, tossed up, driven crisply but can't go past short extra cover"

28.2,7,"PWH de Silva to Pollard, OUT, bowled him with a googly first ball. Sri Lanka are shutting the door on West Indies now. Great ball from Hasaranga, got it to pitch at that perfect length that draws the batsman forward, but he still can't get to the pitch of the ball. Pollard went to drive through cover, but the ball hissed through between bat and pad/body to rattle timber."
28.1,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, flatter on the stumps, tucked to backward square leg"
27.6,7,"Sandakan to Chase, OUT, goes through him. Nice little loop and dip, pitches around off and turns sharply into the right-hander. Chase is playing completely down the wrong line, trying to work it from off stump, it spins through the gap between bat and pad and crashes into the stumps."
27.5,0,"Sandakan to Chase, no run, tossed up on the stumps, flicked but straight to short midwicket"
27.4,1,"Sandakan to Pooran, 1 run, length outside off, tapped into the covers for a single"
27.3,4,"Sandakan to Pooran, FOUR runs, Pooran showing his power now. Goes back and pulls this from low down, sends it to the wide long-on boundary. Again good timing"
27.2,0,"Sandakan to Pooran, no run, flatter and quicker outside off, punched towards cover. The man at short cover dives to his right and stops the ball"
27.1,4,"Sandakan to Pooran, FOUR runs, down the track and over the top. This had to happen because West Indies needed to step on it. Skips down, gets to the pitch, and connects nicely to send it over mid-on. Good timing. No long-on there so a safe shot too"
26.6,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, didn't read the googly, went right back to a length ball but managed to whip it to backward square leg"

25.6,0,"Sandakan to Pooran, no run, "
25.5,1,"Sandakan to Chase, 1 run, tossed up outside off, uses his wrists to clip this to mid-on's right, but the fielder does well to dive to his right and save"
25.4,0,"Sandakan to Chase, no run, fuller, driven languidly to long-on"

24.6,1,"PWH de Silva to Chase, 1 run, slightly shorter, punched through cover-point"
24.5,0,"PWH de Silva to Chase, no run, fuller on off, driven inside out but short cover intercepts. The dot balls are piling up for west Indies"

23.1,1,"Sandakan to Pooran, 1 run, thrown up wide outside off, and he cuts it through point"
22.6,1,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, 1 leg bye, flatter on leg stump, swept fine. Controlled shot, didn't try to hit it too hard. They take a quick single"

22.4,2,"PWH de Silva to Chase, 2 runs, drags it slightly short and Chase goes back, fetches the whip from outside off and goes uppish, but clears the in-field"
22.3,0,"PWH de Silva to Chase, no run, tossed up again and full, driven forcefully but can't beat cover"
22.2,0,"PWH de Silva to Chase, no run, tossed up, driven back to the bowler on the front foot"

20.1,7,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, OUT, googly does it! Was only half forward to it, didn't read the wrong un at all, and was trying to work it through midwicket. It spun across him, got an edge and flew to slip, who held on smartly."
19.6,4,"Mathews to Chase, FOUR runs, length outside off stump, and that's superbly timed. Didn't seem to be much firmer than a push through the covers, but the offside sweeper has a lot of ground to cover, and doesn't quite get there."
19.5,0,"Mathews to Chase, no run, length on  off stump, and again it stops a little on the track. Chase a bit early on the shot and it's a little aerial as he pushes it back. But it lands safe."

18.5,1,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, 1 run, slower, legbreak straightening on the stumps. Not a lot of turn. Clipped away into empty space on the legside infield"
18.4,0,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, no run, flatter again, legbreak on the legs. Turned around the corner but straight to short fine leg"
18.3,0,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, no run, googly!. This is a little short to really be a wicket taking threat, but Bravo didn't read it and didn't even get close to getting bat on it"
18.2,0,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, no run, a flatter legbreak again, punched to short cover"
18.1,0,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, no run, flat, fired into the legs, dug out to short midwicket"
17.6,1,"Mathews to Bravo, 1 run, length outside off, hit away to the offside sweeper"
17.5,0,"Mathews to Bravo, no run, length on the stumps. Bravo clips it to midwicket."
17.4,1,"Mathews to Chase, 1 run, length outside off, Chase opes the face on this one and strokes this away to third man"
17.3,0,"Mathews to Chase, no run, length outside off, just pushed away to cover"
17.2,0,"Mathews to Chase, no run, fullish and on the stumps, driven to mid on."
17.1,7,"Mathews to Hope, OUT, Mathews has made the prize breakthrough. This is fullish, just outside off stump and angled in to Hope, who tries to lift this over the legside. The ball seems to stop on him a little bit though, and Hope is through the shot early. He gets a toe-end to the ball, which just floats up to the man at short midwicket. Huge wicket for Sri Lanka, and Mathews is joyous."
16.6,1,"PWH de Silva to Hope, 1 run, straighter and flatter, struck aerially to long off, but drops very well short of the fielder down there"
16.5,0,"PWH de Silva to Hope, no run, draws Hope forward with some lovely flight, and then beats his outside edge with the turn after pitching it just outside off. Kusal Perera takes the bails off, but Hope's foot is grounded."
16.4,1,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, 1 run, clipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
16.3,1,"PWH de Silva to Hope, 1 run, shorter and flatter, Hope pulls this away viciously, but short midwicket gets a hand to it and keeps it to one - the ball eventually fielded by long on, after taking that deflection. That's another SHai Hope fifty though. He's PROLIFIC in Asia."
16.2,1,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, 1 run, straighter and fuller. Bravo gets over the top of that one and turns it to square leg for a single"
16.1,0,"PWH de Silva to Bravo, no run, floated up on the stumps, turning in. Fended to short midwicket"
15.6,1,"Mathews to Bravo, 1 run, length ball on the pads, knocked to square leg for a single."

15.4,1,"Mathews to Hope, 1 run, on the stumps, turned away to deep midwicket"

15.1,0,"Mathews to Hope, no run, length outside off, pushed to cover"
14.6,2,"Udana to Bravo, 2 runs, on the pads, clipped away to deep midwicket"
14.5,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, a shortish slower ball, which Bravo ducked and which seemed to pass quite far down leg. But it's not called a wide."
14.4,1,"Udana to Hope, 1 run, length on the pads, tucked away to vacant square leg"
14.3,3,"Udana to Bravo, 3 runs, lovely timing. Full ball outside off, driven through the covers, Dimuth Karunaratne chases that one and hauls it in just before it gets to the boundary."
14.2,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, back of a length outside off stump, Bravo's weight is back, and he punches that straight to short cover"
14.1,0,"Udana to Bravo, no run, bouncer, and Bravo ducks underneath that one"
13.6,0,"Mathews to Hope, no run, length ball on the stumps, kept a little low. Hope hunches over as he keeps that one out."

13.4,1,"Mathews to Bravo, 1 run, fuller and tighter into the stumps, poked away towards cover and they gallop through"
13.3,4,"Mathews to Bravo, FOUR runs, short, angled across the batsman, and Bravo latches on to that lightning-fast, pulling that high over midwicket for his first boundary. Timed superbly."
13.2,1,"Mathews to Hope, 1 run, knocked down to long on"

12.3,0,"Udana to Hope, no run, length on off stump, pushed to mid off"
12.2,7,"Udana to Hope, OUT, sensational fielding, and a run out breaks the partnership. I think this one is on Shai Hope. He clips this one square of midwicket and he thought he had beaten Angelo Mathews, but Mathews leaps to his right and cuts that one off. Hope has called Ambris through for a single, but seeing suddenly that Mathews has the ball in hand, he changes his mind. Only, Ambris is two thirds down the pitch now. Hope scampers back to the striker's end, and Ambris is nowhere as the throw comes in from Mathews, and the bowler Udana takes the bails off. Hope might even had made it had he committed to the run."
12.1,1,"Udana to Ambris, 1 run, short ball outside off stump, pulled away to the legside sweeper"
12.1,1,"Udana to Ambris, 1 wide, way down the legside"
11.6,1,"Mathews to Ambris, 1 run, back of a length outside off stump, punched down to long on"
11.5,1,"Mathews to Hope, 1 run, length on the stumps, clipped square of midwicket who chases it back into the outfield and keeps it to one."
11.4,0,"Mathews to Hope, no run, length ball outside off. Punched directly to short cover."
11.3,1,"Mathews to Ambris, 1 run, a more ambitious hit from Ambris. Drives this full delivery, slightly aerially, down the ground to long on."
11.2,0,"Mathews to Ambris, no run, length again, on off stump. Ambris tries to work this to leg but not a lot of power behind that. No thought of a single"
11.1,1,"Mathews to Hope, 1 run, length on the stumps, knocked down to long on"
10.6,0,"Udana to Ambris, no run, quicker one, short ball angled across the batsman. Ambris tries to pull this but gets an under-edge and it dribbles away on to the legside"
10.5,1,"Udana to Hope, 1 run, slower ball again, outside off stump, punched away to deep cover"
10.4,1,"Udana to Ambris, 1 run, fullish, outside off stump. Slower ball again. Ambris hits this straight and gets a single as mid off scrambles to get across and cut it off"
10.3,1,"Udana to Hope, 1 run, slower ball outside the off stump. Hope waits for it and squirts it away to third man"
10.2,0,"Udana to Hope, no run, length outside off stump, turned away straight to short midwicket"

9.1,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, length outside off, tapped to point"
8.6,0,"Udana to Ambris, no run, fuller outside off, pushes away from the body to mid-on"
8.5,0,"Udana to Ambris, no run, yorker on the fifth stump, beats his attempted glide"
8.4,3,"Udana to Hope, 3 runs, gorgeous. Back of a length outside off, he stands tall, goes on tip toes and punches through cover. They probably thought it's going to the boundary but it's into the wind and Hasaranga slides and saves. The batsman ran only two"
8.3,4,"Udana to Hope, FOUR runs, great timing. Length ball on leg stump clipped away effortlessly through midwicket. Hardly any flourish but it still goes all the way with sheer timing"
8.2,0,"Udana to Hope, no run, length ball on leg stump, hint of movement across the right-hander, who jams his bat down in time. Ball takes the outer half to mid-off"
8.1,1,"Udana to Ambris, 1 run, fuller on the stumps, turned to midwicket"
7.6,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, full outside off, textbook cover drive but great diving stop by Mathews at cover, who went to his right"
7.5,3,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, 3 runs, full on the stumps, goes aerial with his on-drive and lifts it over mid-on. Not perfectly timed, so Sandakan has enough time to pull it in before the ropes, running back from mid-on"
7.4,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, fuller, clipped to mid-on"
7.3,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, oooh that kept low. Think he rolled his fingers over it, pitched on a length and scooted through outside off"
7.2,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, length ball, punched to point"
7.1,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, length ball outside off, mis-times his punch to extra cover"
6.6,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, length outside off, patted to mid-off"
6.5,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, dropped at short fine leg. The butter fingers continue into the second innings? Or is it the wind. This was on the pads, whipped straight to the fielder. Bursts through his hands"
6.4,2,"Pradeep to Hope, 2 runs, length on the pads, clipped to deep square leg. They sprint back for a second"
6.3,4,"Pradeep to Hope, FOUR runs, superbly done. This was very straight and Hope just went across and flicked it off his pads. Got the timing right and placed it perfectly to beat short fine leg"
6.2,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, fuller outside off, goes across and punches to mid-on"
6.1,4,"Pradeep to Hope, FOUR runs, fuller on the stumps, worked off his pads through square leg. In fact, he's timed it so well it just purrs all the way to the boundary. Seemed like a gentle flick at first, but was hit extremely well"
5.6,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, fuller outside off, clipped to mid-on"
5.5,1,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, 1 run, fuller on off, goes for the big shot, trying to heave to cow corner. No timing at all from Ambris so far in the innings though and he gets a thickish inside edge to square leg"
5.4,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, length ball outside off, looked like he wanted to slash it but changed his mind because there was no room. ends up bunting it past the bowler"
5.3,3,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 3 runs, Fuller on middle and leg, comes forward and flicks it off his toes through midwicket"
5.2,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, fullish length outside off, flicked to square leg"
5.1,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, length outside off, punched to mid-off"
4.6,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, length ball on off, tapped to midwicket"
4.5,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, beaten. Great line, drawing a poke outside off and on a good length, zipping through. Ambris is reaching for the ball with bat far away from body"
4.4,4,"Pradeep to Ambris, FOUR runs, short ball, and he spotted it early. Dealt with it very well, moved across and went back to hammer a pull shot to deep midwicket, riding the bounce"
4.3,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, full outside off, big stride out to defend to mid-off"
4.2,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, length ball on the pads, flicked to fine leg. Very well timed but there was a man there"
4.1,4,"Pradeep to Hope, FOUR runs, shot. Blasted down the ground with a powerful punch through the line. Went flat and hard over the bowler's head"
3.6,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, fuller outside off, goes for the drive again but can only mis-time to mid-off"
3.5,4,"NLTC Perera to Hope, FOUR runs, pierces the gap. Much needed boundary for West Indies, nice punch through extra cover. Well timed."
3.4,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, a bit too early into the drive, he's falling over a little too while playing it, and gets an inside edge that goes to square leg. Was playing with bat well away from body"
3.3,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, length ball in the channel, he can only tap it to point"
3.2,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, fuller outside off, comes on the front foot and drives, but straight to cover"
3.1,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, length ball on the stumps, worked to midwicket"

2.4,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, fuller on off, driven to mid-off"
2.4,1,"Pradeep to Ambris, 1 wide, dug in short, good idea to change it up, but that's too far above the batsman and is called wide. The keeper had to leap high and just about gathered it."
2.3,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, nipping back in again, beats his inside edge and hits him on the pad"
2.2,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, length on off, defended back to the bowler"
2.1,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, back of a length outside off, bounces a bit and Hope has to take his hand off the bat handle while tapping it to midwicket"

0.6,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, good length on a tight off-stump line, defended back to the bowler from the crease"
0.5,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, leading edge falls short of cover. Straight ball, moves a bit off the seam, he was looking to work it through midwicket"

0.1,2,"Pradeep to Hope, 2 runs, full and straight, clipped off the pads to deep midwicket"
49.6,7,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, OUT, moves way across to try and scoop this over the keeper but misses it. They sneak through for a bye. Hope flicks to the stumps, but doesn't connect. Cottrell's gone back to the stumps, and gathers the ball to break the stumps. Manages to do it despite gathering a fair distance away and the batsman is inches short."
49.5,1,"Cottrell to Udana, 1 run, length ball, flicked to midwicket"
49.4,1,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, 1 leg bye, misses the sweep but it rolls off his pad to short fine leg"
49.3,4,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, FOUR runs, blasted through extra cover. Salt into Cottrell's wounds. Full ball and punched beautifully through the gap"
49.2,3,"Cottrell to Udana, 3 runs, Fabian Allen shells an easy catch at deep square leg. This has been a poor day in the field for West Indies.. Would have been five for Cottrell. This was flicked off his toes, but off the end of the bat and went up high. Allen seemed to have it covered, but ends up letting it go through his hands. Is the wind a factor in these drops?"
49.1,4,"Cottrell to Udana, FOUR runs, just clears the man at point. Full outside off, makes room and tries to drive, gets a thick edge that flies in the air. The man at point leaps but can't get more than a ghost of a finger-tip to the ball."
48.6,3,"Paul to Udana, 3 runs, smashes this over extra cover, and Pollard at long-off has to run around a long way to cut it off before the boundary"
48.5,4,"Paul to Udana, FOUR runs, terrific effort from Holder at long-on but the ball goes to the boundary. Great shot too. He connects with the swat down the ground. Holder's not at a straight long-on, but makes good ground, dives and gets a hand to the ball, but can't stop it"
48.4,2,"Paul to Udana, 2 runs, just clears mid-off. Makes room and flat-bats it over the bowler. Not timed and Pollard's running backwards after it, but can't quite reach it."
48.3,1,"Paul to PWH de Silva, 1 run, fuller and straight, he goes over the top of the bowler's head. Doesn't time it well though. Falls safe"
48.2,2,"Paul to PWH de Silva, 2 runs, wide yorker, he gets bat on it and sends it through point. Two fielders after it, one from backward point and one from deep cover, and they get in a tangle. And the batsmen take two."
48.1,4,"Paul to PWH de Silva, FOUR runs, slower ball, floated up and ends up as a full toss outside off. Hasaranga waits for it and calmly drives it through backward point by opening the bat face and giving himself room"
47.6,0,"Cottrell to Udana, no run, good length on the stumps again, driven back without timing. Cottrell fields to his left on his follow through"
47.5,0,"Cottrell to Udana, no run, good length on the stumps, patted to the bowler's right, who fields it on his follow through"
47.4,0,"Cottrell to Udana, no run, length ball angling across him, the batsman has a poke at it and misses"
47.3,7,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, OUT, cleans him up. Muted celebration from Cottrell. Thisara's entertaining cameo is over. He backed away again, but unlike Joseph, Cottrell kept it full on the stumps. Thisara missed, and the bowler hit."
47.2,1,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, 1 run, length ball stump to stump, comes forward and opens the face to steer to cover"
47.1,1,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 1 run, yorker on leg stump, heaved to long-on off the bottom half of the bat"
46.6,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, making room again and the bowler bowls back of a length again, this one is pulled to deep square"
46.5,0,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, no run, super  ball. Bowls a bouncer that Thisara can only duck under at the last moment. Thisara was backing away again but Joseph bowled the bouncer on the right line to have the batsman in trouble"
46.4,2,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, they're bowling to Thisara as if he's taking guard three stumps outside leg - which is where he's hitting the ball from because he's trying to make room every ball. He gets bat on this, swat-pulls it to long-on"
46.3,1,"Joseph to PWH de Silva, 1 run, slower ball, ends up as a full toss on the stumps. Hasaranga makes room and slaps to the man on the cover boundary"
46.2,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, another back of length ball into Thisara's body, who is continuously backing away. Chops this to point"
46.1,2,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, backing away a long way but Joseph follows him with a yorker. Tries to flick it, doesn't time it but it loops up and falls well short of deep square leg"
45.6,4,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, FOUR runs, that's beaten the keeper. Good ball again, short and into the batsman, who moved inside the line and tried to pull it. Got a bit of glove - or bat - on it and it was enough to send it over Shai Hope, who tried to leap up to gather but couldn't quite get there"
45.5,0,"Cottrell to PWH de Silva, no run, good ball first up, back of a length and close to the body, he sways out of the way"
45.4,7,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, OUT, knocked him over and Cottrell does his salute for the third time today. This was a 'you miss, I hit' kind of ball. Length on leg stump, with Dhananjaya backing away again to go over cover. Doesn't connect and the ball cannons into leg stump"
45.3,4,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, slashed fine for a boundary. Was giving himself room, Cottrell bowled it back of a length on off and Dhananjaya got a thick edge that went to the fence"
45.2,1,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 1 run, back of a length outside off, he goes for the pull. Doesn't time it at all, but that lack of timing also means it falls well short of the deep midwicket fielder who's charging in"
45.1,2,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, goes for the yorker, but ends up as a low full toss on leg stump, flicked away to long-on's left"
44.6,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, follows the batsman who is backing away with a back of length ball into the body. Thisara manages to bunt it towards point"
44.5,0,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, no run, another short ball. That's probably the length and line to bowl to Thisara, push him on the back foot with balls that rise up at pace. He can't connect again"
44.4,0,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, no run, Joseph is the only one who has bowled short effectively - at times at least - for West Indies. Another one banged in at pace and Thisara can't do much about that except let it sail past"
44.3,1,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 1 run, good bowling. yorker on the fifth stump, jams it towards silly mid-off. No one close in so they get a quick single"
44.2,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, backing away again but the bowler follows him that time and he can only punch this to cover"
44.1,4,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, carved through slip. there are no slips of course at this stage, but that's where the ball went. Full toss outside off, and he was making room, ends up slicing it a bit. Fine enough to get the boundary"
43.6,1,"Paul to NLTC Perera, 1 run, fuller outside off, stroked to extra cover"
43.5,2,"Paul to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, fuller outside off, he was giving himself room, stretches out and guides it through backward point"
43.4,3,"Paul to DM de Silva, 3 runs, Thisara charges back for the third. This was a length ball outside off that was cut through point. No fielder there and the ball was not going to reach the fence, Thisara spotted that and hared back"
43.3,4,"Paul to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, slower ball, floated up outside off and Dhananjaya almost casually smacks it over the bowler. Didn't time it perfeclty but there is no long-off and once he went over mid-off it was a  boundary"
43.2,1,"Paul to NLTC Perera, 1 run, length ball, punched to cover"
43.1,4,"Paul to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, super shot. Floated up outside off on a full length, he punches on the up through extra cover. Such magnificent timing on that, it runs all the way to the boundary. Long-off was running to his right but the ball beats him"
42.6,7,"Joseph to Mathews, OUT, castled with a beauty. Pacy yorker that's coming into him, Mathews was trying to flick it from off stump through midwicket, gets a faint inside edge and the ball clatters into the stumps"
42.5,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, short ball on the stumps, he stays still and pulls from in front of his face to deep midwicket"
42.4,1,"Joseph to Mathews, 1 run, back of a length on off, tucked to backward square leg"
42.3,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, length ball on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
42.2,7,"Joseph to Fernando, OUT, Keemo catches it safely this time. Was giving himself room, and Joseph banged it in short and followed the batsman. Avishka still got it in his hitting area, and swatted it to deep midwicket. Keemo Paul on the boundary there and holds it over his head with both hands. Superb innings from Avishka."
42.1,2,"Joseph to Fernando, 2 runs, Keemo Paul drops a dolly at long-off. West Indies have had a forgettable day in the field. this was fuller on leg, and the bat turned in his hands as he tried to clear his leg to deposit it outside the boundary. Went straight to Keemo, who juggled and dropped it"
41.6,4,"Holder to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, takes full toll of the free hit. Not the best ball, half volley on leg stump and he flicks it off his toes to the vacant backward square leg area. Holder's got his hands on his hips, but he's got only himself to blame for the no-ball and the free hit ball."
41.6,2,"Holder to Fernando, (no ball) 1 run, yorker length on the stumps, gets an inside edge while trying to swing it over midwicket and gets a single to fine leg. But Holder has over-stepped so it's a no-ball"
41.5,2,"Holder to Fernando, 2 runs, clears his front leg, and clubs this to long-on. Magnificent running by Thisara who was going to the danger end and called for two. Both men make it safely"
41.4,4,"Holder to Fernando, FOUR runs, slower ball, ends up as a full toss and he's whacked it nonchalantly to deep square leg. Hits it into the wind too, and the ball fairly flies away."
41.3,1,"Holder to NLTC Perera, 1 run, slower ball wide yorker, he stretches out and gets his bat horizontal to steer it to third man"
41.2,4,"Holder to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, short outside off, he gets up on his toes and slashes it over point. Superb execution and he gets a boundary"
41.1,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, was giving himself room but Holder follows him with a low full toss. He manages to whip it to deep midwicket from close to his body"
40.6,0,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, no run, bangs it in short and it zooms over Thisara's head as he ducks under."
40.5,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, fuller on the stumps, pushed to long-on"
40.4,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, back of a length trying to tuck him up, fended towards deep midwicket. Almost a run out as Fernando turned back for two even as Thisara was yelling no. Not a good throw to the keeper though who had to come forward a long way to collect. Tried to back flick it on the stumps but missed."
40.3,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, fuller on middle and leg, whipped off his toes between long-on and deep midwicket"
40.2,7,"Joseph to Mendis, OUT, and the partnership is finally broken, but only because both men are looking to get a boundary every ball almost. Cleared his front leg and wanted to swing this over cow corner, only ends up with a leading edge that goes straight up, high in the air. Hope calls for it, comes up to the stumps and catches it safely in his gloves. End of a fine, fine innings."
40.1,2,"Joseph to Mendis, 2 runs, West Indies are falling to pieces! Comical bit of mis-fielding by Ambris at fine-leg. The batsman went down to scoop it over fine leg once again, but didn't get enough on it. Ambris had the misfortune of seeing it drop short of him and bounce over him."
39.6,2,"Pollard to Fernando, 2 runs, full, on leg stump, glances it and Alzarri Joseph does well to stop it at short fine leg. Can't stop two though."
39.5,4,"Pollard to Fernando, FOUR runs, that's maybe the best-hit shot of the whole over. Backs away again. Once more Pollard is bowling length. Avishka hits it with the wind, back over Pollard's head again, and that lands maybe 10 metres short of the boundary before skating away"
39.4,4,"Pollard to Fernando, FOUR runs, more runs. Backing away and making space to launch another ball high over mid off for another boundary. These two are having fun."
39.3,4,"Pollard to Fernando, FOUR runs, Avishka gets into the swing of things. Fuller, just outside off stump, A nice clean swing through the line, and no fielder is going to cut that off as it goes for four behind the bowler"
39.2,1,"Pollard to Mendis, 1 run, shovels this aerially over midwicket now, but there's not so much power in that shot. Just a single"
39.1,4,"Pollard to Mendis, FOUR runs, Mendis really looking to put the pedal to the floor now. Pollard is bowling length on the stumps, and the batsman backs away to blast that over mid off for four"
38.6,1,"Cottrell to Mendis, 1 run, "
38.5,4,"Cottrell to Mendis, FOUR runs, fuller ball, Mendis squeezes this to the left of mid off for a single"
38.4,4,"Cottrell to Mendis, FOUR runs, that's terrific batting. Fine leg went finer after that previous shot. This time Mendis doesn't shuffle to off. He stays rooted and whips it through square leg, and the fielder that now has gone finer has no chance to cut that off."
38.3,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, tries it again, and this time connects. Moves across again, and is in a good enough position to middle it. There's no fielder in sight as it skips away to the rope."
38.2,1,"Cottrell to Fernando, 1 run, tries to get fancy now, Mendis. It's fuller and outside off stump, but Mendis tries to shuffle across and scoop it over his shoulder. Collects nothing but fresh air though."
38.2,3,"Cottrell to Fernando, 3 wides, more on the middle stump line this time, and Avishka turns it to midwicket"
38.1,0,"Cottrell to Fernando, no run, that's legside-ish as well. Gets it fine of fine leg for a couple"
37.6,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, nicely done Avishka. Gets to his second ODI hundred with a single in the direction of the covers. Gets his helmet off, does a skip and a fist pump and salutes the dressing room and the crowd. Both his centuries have come against West Indies, the first having come against them in the World Cup last year."
37.5,1,"Paul to Mendis, 1 run, shortish wide of off stump. Clubbed with a horizontal bat towards long on. In the air again, but falls well short"
37.4,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, doing it in singles. This is length on off stump. Worked to long on."
37.3,1,"Paul to Mendis, 1 run, fullish and on the stumps, hit in the air to long on, where the fielder runs around to his right and collects on the third or fourth bounce"
37.2,0,"Paul to Mendis, no run, shortish outside off, clubbed straight to mid off"
37.1,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, on the pads, and clipped happily to leg again. Fernando not in a massive hurry to get to another hundred, it seems."
36.6,1,"Cottrell to Fernando, 1 run, floated up leg stump delivery, clipped gently to leg for a single"
36.5,1,"Cottrell to Mendis, 1 run, shortish, on the pads, swatted around the corner for a single"
36.4,1,"Cottrell to Fernando, 1 run, fullish, outside off, pushed to the left of mid off"
36.3,1,"Cottrell to Mendis, 1 run, He gets there! Fullish outside off. He reaches out and drives it past cover and there's a bit of a yelp of joy. Hugs Avishka and there's just a cursory raise of the bat. It's his first ODI hundred since March 2017. And the first century from No.4 since 2017 as well. He's badly needed a big score, Mendis."
36.2,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, length just outside off. Mendis hits towards mid on this time, but again can't beat the field."
36.1,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, slower ball I think, length outside off stump. Mendis pokes it into the offside but can't find a gap"
35.6,0,"Paul to Fernando, no run, slower ball on the stumps. Avishka waits for it and defends it to midwicket"
35.5,1,"Paul to Mendis, 1 run, length ball outside off stump. Mendis drives that down to long on once more. Been a productive area for him"
35.4,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, length ball on the stumps, Avishka flicks and it's far enough to the right of square leg for the batsmen to run through"
35.3,1,"Paul to Mendis, 1 run, slower ball, but it's a full toss. Mendis swats that down to long on"
35.2,0,"Paul to Mendis, no run, full and wide of off stump. Mendis is slightly quick on the shot and can't get it past short cover"
35.1,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, full and on the stumps, flicked off the toes to deep square"
34.6,1,"Cottrell to Fernando, 1 run, on the hips from Cottrell. How many times have we seen these batsmen milk this line today? Turned to square leg for one."
34.5,0,"Cottrell to Fernando, no run, clipped straight to midwicket"
34.4,1,"Cottrell to Mendis, 1 run, shortish, on the stumps, Mendis clips this into the legside for one"
34.3,1,"Cottrell to Fernando, 1 run, gets it to short third man and they have to scamper for one. If it had been a direct hit, Mendis might have been in trouble. He dives to make his ground"
34.2,1,"Cottrell to Mendis, 1 run, shortish, sliding across the batsman, Avishka opens the face and runs it to third man"
34.1,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, full and on off stump, pushed to cover"
33.6,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, this is slower, and a touch shorter, spinning into the pads. Mendis slides back and turns this to square leg for one."
33.5,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, full and straight, the long on fielder gets another little work out."
33.4,2,"Chase to Fernando, 2 runs, flatter and on the stumps, Avishka pushes this square of long on, and they can take two"
33.3,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, slower, floated up. Driven to long on again."
33.2,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, flat on the off stump, driven to long off by Avishka"
33.1,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, flatter, and on the stumps. Knocked down to long on for one."
32.6,3,"Pollard to Mendis, 3 runs, He's been trying to do this all over. This is full and slow again, and finally Mendis gets it fine of short third man, and there's a chase. The batsmen run well to get three. Mendis is into the 90s."
32.5,0,"Pollard to Mendis, no run, oh dear. Very slow ball from Pollard. Mendis' eyes light up and he nearly swings himself off his feet trying t hit this full ball over long on. Misses completely."
32.5,1,"Pollard to Mendis, 1 no ball, fuller, and again Mendis tries to beat short third man but can't. It's a front-foot no ball though, so there's a free hit coming up now."
32.4,0,"Pollard to Mendis, no run, offcutter again I think, and wide of the stumps. Mendis opens the face and tries to run it fine, but it's straight to third man"
32.3,2,"Pollard to Mendis, 2 runs, not that short, but Mendis picks the offcutter, and hacks that one over the legside. The legside sweeper has work to do to get across to deep midwicket and they take a couple easily."
32.2,1,"Pollard to Fernando, 1 run, offcutter, well wide of off stump. Avishka pushes it through the covers for one."
32.1,0,"Pollard to Fernando, no run, pushed to the left of midwicket. Mendis has set off for a single and is about a third down the pitch before being turned back. Safe in the end."
31.6,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, tighter into the stumps this time, and Mendis cuts it straight to point"
31.5,2,"Chase to Mendis, 2 runs, waited beautifully for that one. This is shortish, turning in slightly from wide of off stump. Mendis gets on the back foot and takes it almost out of the keepers hands, gets it fine of short third man for a couple"
31.4,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, floated up on the stumps, driven unfussily to long on"
31.3,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, full and wide of off stump, pushed straight of point, and the batsmen trot through"
31.2,2,"Chase to Mendis, 2 runs, down the track and Mendis lofts this one into the legside, into the gap behind midwicket. Easy two"
31.1,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, flat and full, Mendis is struck on the pad trying to turn this to leg I think, but that's hit him outside the line"
30.6,1,"Pollard to Mendis, 1 run, shorter, on the legside again. Mendis has been turning those around the corner all day. Does so again."
30.5,1,"Pollard to Fernando, 1 run, slightly quicker this one, and tight into the stumps. Avishka pushes it straight of cover and gets one."
30.4,0,"Pollard to Fernando, no run, fuller, and on the pads. Avishka unambitiously pushes it to short midwicket"
30.3,0,"Pollard to Fernando, no run, length on the stumps. Legcutter maybe. Avishka just wants to have a look at what he's doing and defends"
30.2,1,"Pollard to Mendis, 1 run, floated up wide of the off stump, Mendis steps out and check-drives it to long on for an easy single"

29.6,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, tossed up but down leg, swept to fine leg"
29.5,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, tossed up outside off, he gets down to sweep it to deep square leg"
29.4,0,"Chase to Fernando, no run, fuller outside off, quicker one, tapped back to the bowler"
29.3,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, fuller on the stumps, swept to short fine leg. They take the quick single. There is a direct hit but I think the non-striker is safe. And replays confirm that he's well in."
29.2,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, given some air outside off, he moves across and clips it but Chase goes to his right and fields"
29.1,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, looped up on middle stump and turning into the batsman, who glances it to short fine leg"
28.6,3,"Joseph to Fernando, 3 runs, fuller but strays on the pads once again and is tickled behind square. Played softly enough that they can come back for three."
28.5,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, low full toss, carved it away by opening the bat face but Allen at point moves quickly to his left to pounce on it"
28.4,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, fuller and very straight again, he's able to come on the front foot and work this to deep square leg"
28.3,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, fuller this time, on the stumps, goes to whip it, gets a thickish inside edge that goes backward of square"
28.2,4,"Joseph to Fernando, FOUR runs, again too short and going down leg, he easily swats it away past short fine leg to collect another boundary"
28.1,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, length ball on off, he moves across and whips it to deep midwicket"
27.6,3,"Allen to Mendis, 3 runs, fuller on leg stump, he sweeps it very fine. Got only a tickle on it so they'll get a couple"
27.5,1,"Allen to Fernando, 1 run, down the track and he goes inside out. Doesn't time it as well but enough to clear the in-field and have it not carry to the man at deep cover"
27.4,0,"Allen to Fernando, no run, hint of room and he goes back and across to slash it but can't beat the in-field"
27.3,1,"Allen to Mendis, 1 run, down the track again, punches with the full face of the bat to long-off"
27.2,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, quicker on, hurried on to him a tad, slaps it to cover"
27.1,1,"Allen to Fernando, 1 run, floated up on off, he makes room and slaps it through point"
26.6,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, length ball, but on the pads, tucked to fine leg"
26.5,2,"Joseph to Fernando, 2 runs, length ball outside off, heaves across the line to deep midwicket. Fernando is slow while turning around for the second and has to scramble and dive. A better throw might have had him in trouble but he's just about made it."
26.5,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 wide, perhaps trying for something extra, strays down legside and it'll be a wide"
26.4,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, quick bouncer - if you're going to bang it in short that's the only way to do it on this pitch. Outside off and took off, flew over the batsman's head and shoulders"
26.3,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, fuller on off, flicked to mid-on"
26.2,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, back of a length banged in hard, comes in a bit but is easily steered to a squarish third man"

25.6,4,"Allen to Mendis, FOUR runs, and he finds the cover fence once again with some sparkling footwork and strokeplay. Down the track and lifts this over the in-field with great timing and placement."
25.5,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, length ball on off, he makes room to slash it, but can't beat short third man"
25.4,4,"Allen to Mendis, FOUR runs, glorious. Tossed up on off, and he comes down the track, gets to the pitch and drives it powerfully over etra cover"
25.3,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, good length outside off, stretches forward and defends"
25.2,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, tossed up outside off, he dances down the track and connects well with a cover drive but can't beat the man inside the circle"

24.6,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, another yorker, on off, tailed in late a bit. The batsman was trying to flick it off his toes but ends up getting an inside edge that rolls off toe towards silly point. They steal a single with no one close in"
24.5,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, yorker on middle and off, digs it out to the bowler's right"
24.4,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, length ball, too straight, turned off his pads to deep midwicket"
24.3,4,"Holder to Mendis, FOUR runs, upper cuts for four. This is superb batting. Dug this one in short outside off and he uses the bounce and pace to lift this over where slips would have been and very fine. In complete control of that shot"
24.2,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, tapped to long-on"
24.1,4,"Holder to Fernando, FOUR runs, gives himself room and slashes this through cover to find the fence. Superb timing and execution. Disdainful of the bowler almost"
23.6,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, fuller outside off, uses his wrists to flick to long-on again"
23.5,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, pushed to long-on for a comfortable single"
23.4,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, fuller on the stumps, punched to long-on"

23.1,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, tossed up on a length on off, turning into him, plays it to midwicket"
22.6,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, back of a length, moves across and punches to mid-on"
22.5,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, short again but in the fifth stump channel. Tries to pull it but doesn't get the timing quite right. Can't beat midwicket"
22.4,2,"Holder to Fernando, 2 runs, fuller, flicked past short fine leg"
22.3,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, back of a length outside off, gets it to bounce a bit, but he plays it close to his body, opening the face of the bat to run it past point"
22.2,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, too short, pulled off the front foot in front of square. There is a sweeper back there"
22.1,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, length outside off, coming into him, jabbed back to the bowler"
21.6,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, bowler gets into a tangle with the non-striker. Length ball that the batsman came on the front foot to clip, went to the bowler's right and Chase dived to save it, got caught up with the non-striker. No harm or injury done."

20.6,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, length outside off, patted gently to long-on"
20.5,1,"Paul to Mendis, 1 run, length ball on the pads, turned off his pads to deep square leg"
20.5,1,"Paul to Mendis, 1 wide, missed out there. Length ball down legside, if he had got bat on the hard sweep he was going for, it would have been four. He doesn't connect. It's a wide though, so they get that extra run"
20.4,0,"Paul to Mendis, no run, fuller on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
20.3,2,"Paul to Mendis, 2 runs, fuller on off, comes on the front foot and drives straight past the stumps. Mid-off has to run back and clean up"
20.2,4,"Paul to Mendis, FOUR runs, not that short, but he created the room by going back and whipping it to the deep square leg fence. Raises his own half-century. It's also the 100-run partnership. These two have revived Sri Lanka after those early strikes"
20.1,1,"Paul to Fernando, 1 run, Fuller length on the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
19.6,4,"Chase to Mendis, FOUR runs, makes an error in length, and Mendis, one of the best against spin in this team, doesn't miss out. He goes back, makes a bit of room and places this nicely behind point, the ball gathering speed down the slope and into the boundary"

19.4,1,"Chase to Fernando, 1 run, floated up on the stumps, driven to long on"
19.3,2,"Chase to Fernando, 2 runs, into the pads this time, and Avishka turns that nicely square of the wicket on the legside, and completes a mature fifty. Just a gentle raise of the bat. Back to back fifties, after having hit one on Saturday also."

17.3,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, first one that's really turned for Allen. Bit short, so Mendis goes back, but it spins away and stays a bit low. In the end all Mendis can do is throw his bat out and get some wood on it."
17.2,1,"Allen to Fernando, 1 run, tossed up, just on off stump. Avishka makes room and pushes this square on the offside for one"
17.1,1,"Allen to Mendis, 1 run, floated up, almost yorker length. Dug out and driven just square of mid on, and they can scamper through"

16.2,4,"Paul to Mendis, FOUR runs, it's not that short, but that's a lovely shot from Mendis. This is slightly wide of off stump and back of a length. Mendis, though, is waiting for it, and gets over the ball nicely to pull it for four, way in front of square."
16.1,0,"Paul to Mendis, no run, length ball outside off, opens the face and fends this to point"
15.6,1,"Allen to Mendis, 1 run, floated up outside off stump, and oh my, that was a little risky. Mendis gets this square of cover, who runs around and collects nicely as the batsmen set off for a single. But he can't get an accurate throw in, which would have challenged Avishka's dive at the striker's end. Hope has way too much work to do to try and gather that throw."
15.5,1,"Allen to Fernando, 1 run, full and on the stumps, driven to long on"
15.4,0,"Allen to Fernando, no run, flatter and shorter, pushed to midwicket."
15.3,1,"Allen to Mendis, 1 run, that's the first sweep of the day, I think. Full and on the stumps. Mendis gets down and over the top of the bounce. Gets it to deep square leg."
15.2,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, floated up on off stump. Mendis prods it back to the bowler."
15.1,1,"Allen to Fernando, 1 run, flatter and shorter, not a lot of turn, Avishka goes back and crunches this out to deep cover"

13.2,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, short and outside off stump. Mendis goes back and cuts it, but doesn't get a lot of power behind it. Straight to point."
13.1,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, floated up on off stump, turning away. Defended back to the bowler"
12.6,4,"Joseph to Fernando, FOUR runs, nice delicate touch, I think. It's shortish and outside off stump. Avishka opens the face at the last moment and runs it at pace very fine, all the way to the third man boundary."
12.5,2,"Joseph to Fernando, 2 runs, slightly shorter and on the stumps, Avishka tries to heave this to the midwicket boundary, but can't get a great connection. It floats up well in front of square on the legside. The deep square leg runs around to clean this up."
12.4,2,"Joseph to Fernando, 2 leg byes, legside again, but not so far down leg that it's a wide. Actually hits the back of Avishka's pads, which takes some of the pace off. They run two."
12.3,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, tighter in, length on about a middle stump line. Fended away to the cover region. Avishka thinks about a run but decides against"
12.2,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, slightly fuller and wider of off stump, defended to cover this time"
12.1,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, length on off stump, driven to mid off"

11.3,2,"Allen to Mendis, 2 runs, sightly shorter again, and Mendis goes back once more to shovel this into a gap behind square leg"
11.2,0,"Allen to Mendis, no run, fired in on about middle stump. They appeal this after it hits Mendis on the pad, but it's probably sliding down leg."
11.1,2,"Allen to Mendis, 2 runs, shortish to begin with, turning away from off stump. Mendis gets back, gets low and pulls that well in front of square, into a gap around midwicket. Easy two."
10.6,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, length ball on the pads, clipped square on the legside, and fine leg has to run in to keep that to one"
10.5,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, full and on middle stump. Defended to midwicket"
10.4,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, length ball, outside off stump, swinging in slightly. Avishka stays rooted to the crease and fends this away to third man"
10.3,0,"Joseph to Fernando, no run, full, almost yorker length, on off stump. Pushed to cover"
10.3,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 wide, more legside issues. That's the fifth wide of the innings, and we're barely through the Powerplay"
10.2,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, short and into the body, a swivel pull from Mendis goes straight to the fine leg fielder, and they take one"
10.2,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 wide, West Indies' discipline issues have carried over into this game. This is down the legside as well."
10.1,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, fullish, on off stump, poked into the covers and they take one"

9.5,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, length outside off, cut to point"
9.4,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, strays down leg again, but the batsman was moving across. Clips his pad on the way to the keeper. Holder is mildly interested in a possible caught behind. Good take from Hope, who dived to his left to gather it"
9.3,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, good length outside off. That line has been most productive for Holder. Pushes the batsman on the back foot with extra bounce and he can only tap it to the bowler's right"
9.2,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, length outside off, cuts it between cover and point"
9.1,4,"Holder to Fernando, FOUR runs, too full and straying down leg once again is Holder, is punished for it this time. He just had to get some bat on it and he did. Beats short fine leg"
8.6,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, fuller on off, tapped to cover"
8.5,1,"Joseph to Fernando, 1 run, fuller on off, punched past the bowler. Mid-off has to go to his right to collect"

8.3,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, fuller outside off, stays still and steers it to third man"

7.6,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, too full, on the pads again and flicked to fine leg"
7.5,3,"Holder to Fernando, 3 runs, leading edge travels over the bowler's head and has to be pulled in from near the long-off boundary. this was not short enough to pull but he stayed back to whack over midwicket, didn't get hold of it"
7.4,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, fuller on the pads, clipped to short fine leg"
7.3,4,"Holder to Fernando, FOUR runs, lovely shot. Too short again, that has not worked for West Indies. Sits up on off and Avishka moves across and pulls it in front of square powerfully"
7.2,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, fuller on off, tried to drive through extra cover but it comes off the inside half of the bat. Pops up in the air for a bit but safe, and goes to mid-off"

6.6,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, goes back to the fuller length and keeps it on a sixth stump line. Left alone"

6.4,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"
6.3,4,"Cottrell to Mendis, FOUR runs, dug it in short, on the stumps, but it doesn't rise much. Mendis shifts weight back, swivels and pulls it to the midwicket fence. Fully in control of the shot throughout"
6.2,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, full on off, driven powerfully but can't beat point"
6.2,1,"Cottrell to Mendis, 1 wide, angling across him but too far outside off and it's a wide"

5.6,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, good length coming into him but outside off, punched back to the bowler"
5.5,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, corrects his line now to outside off. Batsman tried to slap it through the offside but it trickles back to the bowler off the toe end"
5.4,0,"Holder to Fernando, no run, still not getting his line right is Holder, another one that's quite straight. this one is punched to mid-on though and no runs"
5.3,2,"Holder to Fernando, 2 runs, angling into him again, and turned off his pads to fine-leg's left. Not the best bowling, giving the batsman scoring options on the legside, where he has a lot of gaps. It's an offside packed field"
5.2,3,"Holder to Mendis, 3 runs, length ball angling into him, he moves across and short-arm sweeps it to deep midwicket"

4.2,4,"Cottrell to Fernando, FOUR runs, edged to the third man boundary. It's the first four of the innings. Length outside off, and he slashed it very hard. Safe shot in the circumstances because third man was very square"
4.1,0,"Cottrell to Fernando, no run, length ball on a tight line on off, defended carefully into the offside on the back foot"
3.6,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, rapped him on the wrist. Bit of extra bounce again, took off from a length outside off and he was looking to just defend it, but it moves in and bounces more than he bargained for, so gets a hard knock on his right wrist and forewarm. Painful blow."
3.6,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 wide, tries too much and strays down leg. He'll have to re-bowl that"
3.5,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"
3.4,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, dropped by Pollard at first slip. Straightforward chance. Straightened off the seam outside off, and took the shoulder of the bat with some extra bounce. Went at a comfortable height to Pollard's left and he clanged it."
3.3,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, quick single taken from an inside edge to short fine leg. Nipping back in a tad on a fuller length, he was trying to stand tall and punch through cover, but it takes the edge"

2.6,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, length ball outside off, tapped to point"
2.5,0,"Cottrell to Mendis, no run, beaten. What is with the Sri Lanka top order being trigger happy without moving feet? This one was slanted across him on a full length, and he went for the drive, ends up missing it."
2.4,2,"Cottrell to Mendis, 2 runs, goes for the full ball on off, a touch too full perhaps. Mendis stays still and plays it late, with a gentle push to the bowler's left to get off the mark"
2.3,7,"Cottrell to MDKJ Perera, OUT, got 'im first ball! Hint of movement away from the batsman, KJP is new to the crease but decides to go for the big booming drive first up to this full one. No feet moving - just like Dimuth - and he's only managed to get an audible snick through to the keeper."
2.2,7,"Cottrell to Karunaratne, OUT, straight to point. Short, wide and he could have slapped this anywhere. He didn't really move his feet  and stretched to reach for it, ends up slashing it straight to Fabian Allen at point."
2.1,3,"Cottrell to Fernando, 3 runs, full outside off, too full, and he stands up tall to punch it straight back past the bowler"
1.6,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, length ball in the channel, cuts it to point"
1.5,1,"Holder to Fernando, 1 run, length ball, but straying down leg, he tried to get inside the line and hoick it, but doesn't time it too well. Runs down to fine leg"
1.4,1,"Holder to Karunaratne, 1 run, strays on the pads, flicked to fine leg"

49.2,7,"Mathews to Allen, OUT, is that six? No! Caught at deep midwicket In the slot on middle, and Allen goes for the biggie over the leg side. But it's not got the connection he was looking for, and taken by the fielder riding the boundary line"
49.1,4,"Mathews to Allen, FOUR runs, what a start! Short and wide, and Allen tees up before flat-batting over cover"
48.6,0,"NLTC Perera to Joseph, no run, full toss, on middle, and thumped to deep midwicket"

48.4,7,"NLTC Perera to Allen, 1 run, OUT, full on middle, and muscled to long off. Allen wants two again, and looks like Chase is run out for a zero-ball duck because the throw from the deep is accurate again!"
48.3,6,"NLTC Perera to Allen, SIX runs, and that's why Allen came back on strike! Full, outside off, in the slot and he smacks it over the bowler's head for six! All 98 metres of that... over the sight screen. WI need 15 off 9"
48.2,7,"NLTC Perera to Allen, 1 run, OUT, misses the yorker, is a low full toss. Drubbed to long on, and Allen wants to get back strike. Walsh is running to the danger end, and Perera collects the throw to whip the bails off. The umpires go upstairs, but replays confirm that Walsh is out. He did dive, but he fell short by around half an inch. Great throw from Shanaka, the substitute fielder. Good thing for West Indies is that Allen remains on strike"
48.1,1,"NLTC Perera to Walsh, 1 run, full and wide, and edged to point for a single"
47.6,1,"Mathews to Walsh, 1 run, good length, on middle, and flat-batted to long on for a walking single"

47.4,1,"Mathews to Allen, 1 run, dropped by the keeper? Surely looks so with Allen edging this slow and wide ball. Perera dived to his right and got fingertips to it. Hit the outside of his right glove..."
47.3,6,"Mathews to Allen, SIX runs, full, outside off, and Allen goes for a big one. Not the best connection, and the ball's in the air for eternity. Eventually goes just beyond Mendis at long on"

46.5,4,"Udana to Allen, FOUR runs, that shoulder looks fine! Full outside off, and he slices this along the ground, past third man, for another four. Fifteen off the over already..."

45.3,4,"Mathews to Holder, FOUR runs, good length, on middle, and he stays rooted in his crease before pulling over square leg for four"
45.2,7,"Mathews to Pollard, OUT, Mathews gets another breakthrough! Length ball, angling into the stumps, and Pollard skies this attempted swipe. Ball in the air, and Udana runs in to take a diving catch near short midwicket. Massive wicket! Pollard falls just short of 50...."
45.1,4,"Mathews to Pollard, FOUR runs, fullish, very wide outside off, and Pollard slaps this comfortably in front of square. Picks the slower ball and deposits it over cover"

44.6,1,"Udana to Pollard, 1 wide, full, and too wide this time. Nearly off the pitch! Pollard doesn't move and happily takes the wide run"

43.5,0,"PWH de Silva to Pollard, no run, full, just outside off, and he defends with a big stride"
43.4,7,"PWH de Silva to Pollard, OUT, lbw or run out? This was full on middle, and he looks to defend but the ball hits his front leg. The ball squirts away and they try to take the run, but there's been a run out at the bowler's end. Bravo's run out, but Sri Lanka want to review Pollard's decision. Pollard doesn't want that to happen, but Sri Lanka have been allowed the review because of the confusion in the middle. Bravo has meanwhile nearly left the ground, and the DRS shows that Pollard survives his lbw call as well. Sri Lanka were getting a wicket anyway, but reckon they would've preferred Pollard's..."
43.3,0,"PWH de Silva to Pollard, no run, full outside off stump, and defended again. He wants to see this bowler through"

34.6,0,"Udana to Pollard, no run, almost a yorker. Low full toss in the end. This is the quicker one, and Pollard just digs it out. If he's come out early to provide fireworks, he hasn't tried to light the wick yet."

30.6,2,"Udana to Pollard, 2 runs, this is into the thigh pad, and Pollard tucks it around the corner towards deep square leg without a lot of power. This means the fielder has to run in to collect it, and there's time for an easy two."
30.5,0,"Udana to Pollard, no run, another short one, though not quite as short. Outside off again. Pollard bends backwards and lets that past"
30.4,0,"Udana to Pollard, no run, short ball for a welcome. This is chest-high, and outside off stump. Pollard sways out of the way."
30.3,7,"Udana to Hope, OUT, slower ball does it. Udana's specialty. I haven't even seen it closely, but I'm willing to bet that's out of the back of the hand. And yes, it's a legbreak. Hope is through his flick-through-midwicket, and sends a fairly simple catch, in the air, to short midwicket. Another fine Hope innings comes to an end. He's got two half centuries and a hundred in this series."
30.2,1,"Udana to Pooran, 1 run, length again, on off stump, seaming in slightly. Pooran steps forward and drives to long on for a single"

29.2,1,"DM de Silva to Hope, 1 run, floated up into the pads again, and straightening. Hope flicks this to deep midwicket"
29.1,0,"DM de Silva to Hope, no run, tossed up on the legs, just defended into the legside"

27.3,1,"DM de Silva to Hope, 1 run, slows it down a touch and gets a little turn, pitching on middle stump and straightening. Hope gets a thick inside edge and it bounces off towards midwicket as they get a single"
27.2,1,"DM de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, floated up a bit more, and Pooran steps out to drive this through cover"
27.1,1,"DM de Silva to Hope, 1 run, flat, fast short, angled across Hope, who shuffles to off and clips it to midwicket area for a single"
26.6,6,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, SIX runs, and that's Pooran's power! This is floated up, wide of off stump, allowing the batsman to free his shoulders. Doesn't seem like he's even hit it that hard, but he's launched it high over long off for six. West Indies are cruising right now."
26.5,0,"PWH de Silva to Pooran, no run, googly. Pooran's definitely picking it. Goes back and hits it to mid off"

25.5,0,"DM de Silva to Hope, no run, full, fired in. Dug out back to the bowler"
25.4,0,"DM de Silva to Hope, no run, tossed up again, and turning, though not sharply. Hope tries to play it to leg but a leading edge makes it dribble off to the offside"
25.3,1,"DM de Silva to Pooran, 1 run, floated up, pitching outside off, driven to long off"
25.2,0,"DM de Silva to Pooran, no run, flat again, but outside off stump. Pooran tries to get it past short third man but can't beat the fielder"

22.2,0,"PWH de Silva to Hope, no run, full, outside off, and driven straight. Bowler dives to his left, gets a fingertip to it"
22.1,0,"PWH de Silva to Hope, no run, appeal for lbw turned down. Full, on leg stump, and Hope had come down the wicket. He misses the flick, ball hits his boot, but the ball was going down leg stump. Might've been an inside edge too"

21.5,4,"Sandakan to Pooran, FOUR runs, full outside off, but Pooran uses his feet this time. Gently lifts it over wide mid on. Safe shot with nobody there on the leg side"
21.4,1,"Sandakan to Hope, 1 run, falls just short of the fielder at long on. Full on middle, and he comes down the wicket again to take him on. Flies off the bat's inside half, but he's lucky that happened. Would've gone down the fielder's throat otherwise"
21.4,1,"Sandakan to Hope, 1 wide, full outside leg stump, and Hope is swift to get in position for the wide, but misses the connection. Keeper shuffles across to stop the ball with his pads"

18.3,7,"PWH de Silva to Ambris, OUT, the googly does the trick! Quicker ball, lands on off, and turns sharply into middle stump. Ambris backs away to whip it to the leg side, but the ball goes through him! Ambris disappointed walking off, but this was a good performance from him today"
18.2,1,"PWH de Silva to Hope, 1 run, full, outside off, and he presses forward to tap this to extra cover. Walks across, that's his 17th fifty. Late celebration. He didn't know"

17.6,1,"Mathews to Hope, 1 run, full, on his pads, and nudged away to deep backward square. They're happy to settle for one"

13.3,0,"Mathews to Ambris, no run, slower ball, on middle, and Ambris can't whip it behind, deceived. Hits his front leg, but lbw appeal turned down. Ball was going down leg"
13.2,0,"Mathews to Ambris, no run, struck hard past the bowler. Length ball, wide outside off, and punched past Mathews' left. He sticks his hand out to try and take the catch, but he only got his fingertips to it"

12.6,1,"Udana to Ambris, 1 run, yorker length, just outside off. Shoveled to long on. Good over for West Indies"
12.5,2,"Udana to Ambris, 2 runs, short, and wide. Angling across, and he throws his bat at it, to cut over the infield. Shehan - the sub fielder - does some tidy running around the point boundary to intercept"

9.6,4,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, FOUR runs, Ambris goes aerial down the ground again! No risk with that shot, because it's still inside the Powerplay and there are no fielders out. He gets a slightly overpitched ball outside off, and launches this back over the bowler's head. It lands a few metres from the boundary and bounces away towards the sightscreen. An outstanding finish to the initial fielding restrictions for WI."

9.1,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, full, wide of the stumps. Hope crunches this into the off side, but Avishka Fernando at cover is all over that, diving and cutting it off. A saved four."
8.6,0,"Udana to Ambris, no run, another slower one, 113kph. Ambris again gets fooled and tries to go for a big heave, but it barely gets up to knee height and passes under his bat to the keeper"
8.5,0,"Udana to Ambris, no run, length ball on off stump, turned to midwicket"
8.4,0,"Udana to Ambris, no run, slower ball, 99kph, back of the hand. Ambris' eyes light up again, but he's through the shot very early, misses"
8.3,6,"Udana to Ambris, SIX runs, boom! First six of the innings, and Ambris is getting going. Overpitched just outside off from Udana, and Ambris launches that over long on for six. Just clean hitting through the line."

7.5,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, length outside off, just pushed into the infield towards cover"

7.3,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, Ambris is early on this shot. Not the first time we've seen this tonight. Length on the stumps, a 125kph delivery. Ambris spoons this up over the bowler after getting through his drive too soon. They think about a run but decide against"
7.2,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, length on the legs, clipped towards deep midwicket for a single"
7.1,1,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, 1 leg bye, short of a length, into the thigh. Ambris tries to tuck this around the corner, but misses, and it hits his thigh pad. Trickles away to fine leg and they take the leg bye"
6.6,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, short of a length outside off, a little bit of away-movement off the seam. Hope wafts and misses."
6.5,2,"Pradeep to Hope, 2 runs, length on the pads, gets it into a gap towards deep midwicket, and Hope calls early enough and runs hard enough to get a couple"
6.4,1,"Pradeep to Ambris, 1 run, this is pulled away ferociously - a throat high ball outside off stump - but Lakshan Sandakan runs around at fine leg and manages to cut it off. A fantastic shot for just one."
6.3,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, length in the channel, defended back to the bowler"

6.1,4,"Pradeep to Ambris, FOUR runs, floated up again, and this time Ambris latches on to this one. He shuffles across to get close enough to the ball, which is pitched outside off, and he uses his wrists to launch that over midwicket for four."
5.6,4,"NLTC Perera to Hope, FOUR runs, yeeeesh. That's more like it from Hope. He plays a checked cover drive, on the up. Timed so sublimely that no one moves as it scorches through the infield and on to the boundary."
5.5,4,"NLTC Perera to Hope, FOUR runs, edged, but past the wide slip. This is length outside off. Hope tries to push it to cover, gets a thickish edge and it races away to the third man boundary."
5.4,1,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, 1 run, fuller and wider, and perhaps Ambris should have made more of that. He throws his bat at it and drives it far enough away from mid off for a single, but when you're chasing 307, those kinds of balls probably need to be put away"
5.3,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, length, in the channel, poked straight to mid off"
5.2,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, tighter into the stumps this time, and Hope whacks it to mid on, but not with a lot of power, so there's time to take a single"

4.6,2,"Pradeep to Ambris, 2 runs, floated up on the toes, flicked in the air, but far away from the square leg fielder. Fine leg runs around to cut that off and the batsmen take two"

4.4,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, on the pads again, and turned to square leg, where Sandakan makes a diving stop and keeps it to one"

4.2,4,"Pradeep to Hope, FOUR runs, or maybe not... Hope is done just waiting for the bad balls. He runs at Pradeep this time, who sort of sees him coming and bowls at the pads. But Hope has made enough room, and he drills it past the bowler, in the air, and all the way to the fence"
4.1,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, length in the channel, defended into the offside. I should copy/paste this line for when Pradeep is bowling."
3.6,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, big swing across the line to this length ball just outside off. Ambris collects only fresh air though, and it whistles through to the keeper just past that off stump. A few Lankan hands go to heads."
3.5,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, length outside off. Hope hits this firmly to cover, who fumbles it and allows a single"
3.4,4,"NLTC Perera to Hope, FOUR runs, beautifully struck. The first boundary for West Indies. This is full and on the toes, and Hope gets his head over it, turns his wrists and flicks it in front of midwicket. It goes along the ground the whole way, whizzing all the way to the boundary."
3.3,2,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 2 runs, a big shot from Hope!. Again length in the channel, and he launches it high over mid off. He got under it a little too much though, so it goes higher rather than further. Gets a couple as the mid off runs back and reels it in a few metres from the rope"
3.2,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, fuller and outside off stump, in the channel again. Driven with modest power to mid off"
3.1,2,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 2 runs, back of a length, on the pads. Tucked away in front of square leg for a couple."
2.6,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, fuller, a bit of away-movement in the air again, but not much. Ambris just defends this to off"
2.5,2,"Pradeep to Ambris, 2 runs, floated up on to the pads, clipped away nicely by Ambris who bisects mid on and midwicket. Hasaranga tracks it down and keeps it to two"
2.4,0,"Pradeep to Ambris, no run, length on the stumps, defended to leg"
2.3,2,"Pradeep to Ambris, 2 runs, strays into the pads for the first time. Ambris turns this around the corner to fine leg, but there's a scrambling save there from Thisara Perera that prevents a boundary"
2.2,1,"Pradeep to Hope, 1 run, length ball, in that channel again. There's really been only one ball so far that's not been in the channel. Hope drives this on the up, without a lot of power, but far enough away from mid off to allow a single"
2.1,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, hint of shape away from the right-hander for Pradeep now. This is a fullish ball, defended to cover by Hope"
1.6,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, fuller and in the channel again, defended once more. Another cheap over."
1.5,0,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, no run, fuller, outside off stump but still in the channel. Ambris gets over this one and defends it to leg"

1.3,1,"NLTC Perera to Hope, 1 run, length outside off stump, pushed into a gap around the cover region and there's a run there"
1.2,0,"NLTC Perera to Hope, no run, beaten. This is length outside off, and there is a touch of away swing. Hope plays and misses."
1.1,1,"NLTC Perera to Ambris, 1 run, short of a length, on the pads. Turned into the legside off the inside half of the bat, and as it dribbles off between midwicket and point, they take a single"
0.6,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, maiden to start! Sri Lanka's new-ball bowlers have been very stingy this series, and Pradeep makes another good start. This is a length ball outside off. Not wide enough to cut. Not full enough to drive. Hope only defends."
0.5,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, fuller, in the channel once more. Just a touch of seam movement this time, but that's no issue for Hope, who bunts it into the offside again."
0.4,0,"Pradeep to Hope, no run, length on about off stump. Seemed to stop on Hope a touch. Defended into the covers."

49.6,7,"Holder to Udana, OUT, Pollard takes another catch and Holder gets another wicket. Low full toss outside off, and he looks to go over long off. Doesn't have the distance however. Sri Lanka 307 all out"
49.6,1,"Holder to Udana, 1 wide, full outside the tramlines, and Udana can't connect. Wide called"
49.5,7,"Holder to Sandakan, OUT, back of a length on off, and he can't connect with the shot. They run across to try and steal a bye, but the throw from the keeper to Holder is good enough. Sandakan's halfway back when the TV umpire says its out"
49.4,7,"Holder to PWH de Silva, OUT, middle stump clattered as Hasaranga runs across exposing his stumps. Misses the flick while Holder nails the yorker"
49.3,4,"Holder to PWH de Silva, FOUR runs, over mid off! Back of a length on off, and he makes room before flat-batting it over the infield"
49.2,6,"Holder to PWH de Silva, SIX runs, innovative! Holder goes full and wide, but Hasaranga runs across towards the tramlines and opens the leg side completely. Flicks the wrists to hit it over deep backward square"

48.3,7,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, OUT, skyer taken by the substitute fielder Rovman Powell. Full on off, and he slices this attempted slog. Powell gets under from mid off to take the catch in the reverse-cup style"

48.2,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 wide, back of a length, on leg stump, and it goes over his head. Perera lets it go and collects the wide run"
48.1,1,"Joseph to PWH de Silva, 1 run, full, on leg stump, and clipped to deep midwicket. Was in the slot to be put away, but the bat's face turned in his hand"

47.5,1,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 1 run, full, outside leg stump, and lobbed behind square leg for a single"
47.4,2,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, full, on leg stump, and he flicks it in the air, but in the gap near deep midwicket. Comfortable seond"

46.4,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, full, outside leg stump, and he looks to whip this. But hits his pads and rolls away to square leg"
46.3,7,"Joseph to DM de Silva, OUT, slower ball does the trick. Full, outside leg, and he looks to whip it through the on side. Poor connection, and Pollard has to take a step to his right to get behind the ball's line at deep midwicket. Easily taken but a nice applause from the crowd for DDS"
46.2,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, trying a bit too much, one could say. Opens his stance and drops his knees to ramp it over third man. Can't make any connection"
46.1,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, on his pads, and flicked to Walsh at deep midwicket"
45.6,4,"Holder to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, full, on middle, and whipped behind square to reach his fifty in just 45 balls. Epic wristwork The crowd's roaring"
45.5,1,"Holder to NLTC Perera, 1 run, falls safe with three fielders running in as he slices this attempted cut in the air. Holder going short again, and Bravo running in from point came closest to it"

45.2,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, short ball, over his shoulder as he misses the attempted ramp over third man"
45.1,1,"Holder to NLTC Perera, 1 run, low full toss, but quite wide. Perera's cut comes off the toe-end and flies over cover to the fielder in the deep"
44.6,1,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 1 run, just misses the yorker, on leg stump. He drives to long off to keep the strike"
44.5,2,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, good length, just outside off. Flat-bats this to Pollard at long on, but a misfield makes the batsmen take a second. It's risky, Perera has to dive as the keeper whips the bails off. TV replay says not out as Perera's bat is two inches in by the time Hope dislodged the bails"
44.4,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, full, outside off, and he opens the bat's face to play an uppish square drive. Protection in the deep though"

44.2,4,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, up and over! Full, from around the wicket, and he makes room before lifting it over Cottrell's head. Past mid off too. Four early in the over"

43.5,2,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 2 runs, slower ball, full outside off, and he brings his bat down to guide it to short third man. Fielder's effort slows the ball's pace down. Joseph the man"

43.3,4,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, FOUR runs, edged between the keeper and third man. Pollard's slower ball had deceived Perera, but he manages to edge this attempted cut for four"
43.2,0,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, no run, fullish, wideish, but within the tramlines. Perera backs away to make extra room, but that's his downfall. Can't make the connection"
43.1,2,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, good length, outside off, and he slaps this over point for a couple. Fielder at third man has some work to do"
42.6,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, back of a length, outside leg stump, cramping him for space. Gloved past the keeper's right"
42.6,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 wide, yorker length, but outside leg stump. Perera was trying to drill this behind square, but misses the whip"

42.4,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, back of a length on off, and he flat-bats this back past the bowler. But totally mistimed. Stoped at mid off"
42.3,2,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 2 runs, full on leg, and he flicks it very fine off his boots. Fine leg runs across to stop the four, and they collect a quick double"
42.2,4,"Joseph to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, full, but slow. Lands in the slot, and he makes room before clattering a four between mid off and cover"
42.1,1,"Joseph to NLTC Perera, 1 run, good length, on leg stump, trying to cramp him up. Swivels and strikes, but finds deep backward square leg"
41.6,2,"Holder to DM de Silva, 2 runs, back of a length, on middle, and this time he connects with the flat-batted shot. Towards cow corner, and two fielders converge to stop it"
41.5,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, batsman backs away, and bowler follows him. Back of a length on middle, and he misses another wild slog"
41.4,0,"Holder to DM de Silva, no run, good length, outside off, and he clears his front leg to clear mid off. But he loses his shape, and the ball goes through to the keeper"
41.3,4,"Holder to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, slower ball, good length, on middle, and he goes for a wild hoick. Ball stays low, takes the under-edge, and runs past the keeper for four. Holder unlucky"
41.2,1,"Holder to NLTC Perera, 1 run, back of a length, on middle, and he pulls in front of square. Sweeper fielder there to clean up"
41.1,2,"Holder to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, good length, on middle and angling away. He cuts in front of square, forcing the fielder at deep point to run across and retrieve it"
40.6,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, good length, outside off, from around the wicket. Backs away and mistimes a flat-batted shot to mid on"
40.5,5,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 5 runs, it's all happening! Pollard will not be happy. This was punched to cover, but the fielder backing up - Ambris - at fine leg runs in to collect. The ball goes through his hands, however, and hits the fence. Cottrell is fuming"
40.4,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, lands in no man's land. Good length ball, getting big on him. MIstimes the pull, and falls over the fielder at cover. The fielder was in to try and stop the single"
40.3,1,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 1 run, another chance of a direct hit this time at the bowler's end. This was a length ball tapped to Chase at midwicket"
40.2,2,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 2 runs, Direct hit and he's out but the fielder from point - Walsh - misses it at the batsman's end. This was short and wide, and cut to point. Overthrows allow them to take a single"
40.1,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, good length, from around the wicket outside off. He runs it down to third man for a single"
39.6,0,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, no run, full, on midlde and off. He walks across before driving. Pollard dives to his left to get a finger to it"
39.5,0,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, no run, full, on middle, and he looks to drive. Through his shot too early. Mistimed to cover"
39.4,1,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 1 run, good length, angling in. Looks to pull, but splices the shot finer than he would've wanted"
39.3,1,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, 1 run, slow, short ball on leg stump, and he chips it right over short fine leg. Man in the deep cleans up"
39.2,0,"Pollard to NLTC Perera, no run, full, on off, and he drives uppishly. Falls short of cover though"
39.1,1,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 1 run, good length, on off stump. Angling into him, and flicked behind square"

38.5,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, good length, outside off, and chopped to short fine leg"

38.3,1,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, 1 run, good length, on off, and flicked behind square"
38.2,0,"Cottrell to NLTC Perera, no run, comes over the wicket to the left-hander. Good length outside off, and punched to cover"
38.1,7,"Cottrell to Mathews, OUT, bowled 'im! Good length, outside off stump, but angling into the stumps. Except, it didn't angle in as much as Mathews though. He goes for a heave from a middle-stump line, while the ball goes past his bat and crashes into the stumps. Don't forget Cottrell's salute too..."
37.6,1,"Pollard to Mathews, 1 run, slower ball, short of a length, on about off stump. Mathews shuffles to off and tucks this around the corner for a single."
37.5,0,"Pollard to Mathews, no run, length ball outside off stump. Crunched straight to cover."
37.4,0,"Pollard to Mathews, no run, length ball on the stumps delivered from wide of the crease. Mathews defends into the legside"
37.3,1,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 1 run, full outside off stump, driven to mid off, but not with a lot of power, so they can run one"
37.2,0,"Pollard to DM de Silva, no run, fuller now, legside-ish. DDS moves to leg to try and make room, but it actually passes legside of the legstump, and he misses again."
37.1,0,"Pollard to DM de Silva, no run, shortish outside off. DDS tries to run this off the face to third man but doesn't connect"
36.6,1,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 1 run, this is shorter, just outside off stump, but it keeps a bit low. DDS pulls it to deep midwicket for one"
36.5,2,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, 2 runs, length on the pads, once again DDS uses his wrists to clip this straight of midwicket with good timing. A hard-run two again."
36.4,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, length outside off. Pushed to cover"
36.3,1,"Cottrell to Mathews, 1 leg bye, length ball on the pads. Cottrell goes up in appeal as it dribbles towards fine leg and they take a leg bye. Sliding way down leg though."

36.1,0,"Cottrell to DM de Silva, no run, short of a length outside off, poked away to point"
35.6,0,"Pollard to Mathews, no run, short of a length outside off stump. Mathews tries to flay this through the offside, but misses, and Pollard goes up in appeal once Hope has the ball in his gloves. Don't think there was anything on that."
35.5,2,"Pollard to Mathews, 2 runs, full and outside off stump, Mathews plays an identical shot, and they scamper another couple comfortably again. Mathews' new, improved fitness is paying dividends"
35.4,2,"Pollard to Mathews, 2 runs, full outside off, and Mathews clips this straight of midwicket, calls for two straightaway and gets them easily"
35.3,1,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 1 run, super slow, wide of off stump. DDS fetches this from wide of off stump and clubs it to long on"
35.2,1,"Pollard to Mathews, 1 run, offcutter, length on the pads, turned around the corner by Mathews"
35.1,0,"Pollard to Mathews, no run, length ball on the stumps, just knocked into the legside unambitiously."
34.6,4,"Joseph to DM de Silva, FOUR runs, short and wide, and cut-carved behind point for four by DDS, who typically, didn't try to overhit that one. Beautiful timing ruining what otherwise could have been a half-decent over."
34.5,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, length outside off. Driven on the up, but he finds the mid on fielder with that."
34.4,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, back of a length on about off stump. DDS defends, and it takes a thick outside edge and travels straight to backward point"
34.4,1,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 1 wide, this has been a problem for West Indies all series. This wide is on the other side of the stumps, going well outside the tram lines on the offside"
34.4,1,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 1 wide, full, and waaay down the legside. Hope scrambles to his left to stop that"
34.3,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, fuller and wider outside off. DDS drives, but can't beat the man at short cover again"
34.2,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, back of a length, tight into off stump. Punched to short cover"
34.1,2,"Joseph to DM de Silva, 2 runs, length ball, on the pads again. DDS flicks this away far enough from the legside fielder to enable a rapid two"
33.6,1,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 1 run, length on the pads, whipped around the corner to deep square leg"
33.5,1,"Pollard to Mathews, 1 leg bye, length ball, on the pads. Hits Mathews' legs and Pollard goes up in appeal. They run a leg bye. But what's this? Pollard has reviewed it! It didn't look that close tbh. Always appeared to be sliding down leg. Let's see. As suspected, the projection has it missing leg stump."
33.4,2,"Pollard to Mathews, 2 runs, another slower one (aren't they all from Pollard?), on the toes. Clipped to deep midwicket for another couple."
33.3,1,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 1 run, length outside off stump, driven on the up to long on for a single"
33.2,0,"Pollard to DM de Silva, no run, back of a length on off stump. Defended towards mid on"
33.1,2,"Pollard to DM de Silva, 2 runs, slower ball, floated up into the toes, and DDS turns his wrists again and gets this into a big gap around deep midwicket. They get an easy two"
32.6,0,"Joseph to Mathews, no run, length outside off. Defended to cover."
32.5,0,"Joseph to Mathews, no run, fullish, just outside off. Mathews check-drives but can't beat mid on"

32.3,0,"Joseph to DM de Silva, no run, length ball outside off, DdeS watches it go to the keeper"
32.2,7,"Joseph to Mendis, OUT, and then, err, a mistake. Not sure there was anything in that ball to worry Mendis, the way he was batting. But he's out either way. This is a bouncer, at around shoulder height, and Mendis tries to pull again - a shot he had played to excellent effect - but then he can't get over the top of this one, and he mis-hits it in the air. The ball floats up and Pollard runs around from midwicket to take an excellent diving catch near where square leg might stand"
32.1,4,"Joseph to Mendis, FOUR runs, superb timing. Full and on about middle stump. Kusal gets his head over and flicks his wrists beautifully to send it scorching past short midwicket and all the way to the fence."
31.6,0,"Pollard to Mathews, no run, length on the stumps, clipped straight to midwicket"
31.5,4,"Pollard to Mathews, FOUR runs, chest-high short ball, and this is Pollard's first poor delivery. The line was legside as well, and Mathews gets inside the line and helps it fine of fine leg for four, to get his innings started"
31.4,0,"Pollard to Mathews, no run, length on about off stump. Defended into the legside"
31.3,7,"Pollard to MDKJ Perera, OUT, Pollard makes a deserved breakthrough! Not a great shot from Perera though. Another one of those offcutters with a little bit of overspin, angled across and leaving the left-hander. Perera gets low and tries to heave this into the next century over midwicket, but he's playing against the angle and the turn, so to speak, and because there's overspin on this ball, there's a little extra bounce. It takes his top edge and flies into the keeper's gloves. Pollard's been fishing for that dismissal since last over."
31.2,1,"Pollard to Mendis, 1 run, offcutter, I think, length on the pads. Kusal shuffles to off and works this into a gap around midwicket"
31.1,0,"Pollard to Mendis, no run, full and outside off. Mendis tries to get this to third man, but doesn't connect as he wants to and it bounces away square on the offside"
30.6,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, length on the stumps again, and Mendis uses the wrists to turn this past midwicket for a single. That brings up his half century also, after he'd made a terrific hundred in the last game."
30.5,0,"Joseph to Mendis, no run, short of a length ball on about off stump. Defended."
30.4,4,"Joseph to Mendis, FOUR runs, more bad bowling. Full toss, knee height, on the pads. Mendis is more than good enough, and in good enough touch to lift that over square leg and help himself to another boundary"
30.3,1,"Joseph to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, fullish, on about off stump, driven straight of mid off and there's time for a single"
30.2,1,"Joseph to Mendis, 1 run, fuller outside off, run down to third man"
30.1,4,"Joseph to Mendis, FOUR runs, err, was Joseph watching Holder's last over? This is short again, and this is pulled brutally once more through midwicket by Mendis. I've said this several times: short balls are sitting up to be smacked on this pitch"
29.6,4,"Pollard to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, gets the edge this time! But it's a thick enough edge to beat the keeper, and run away fine to the boundary. West Indies haven't given themselves a great chance in this innings, but they've also had some bad luck"
29.5,0,"Pollard to MDKJ Perera, no run, slightly fuller, but almost a carbon copy of the previous ball. Again it's a cutter, and again Perera's drive collects only fresh air"
29.4,0,"Pollard to MDKJ Perera, no run, goes very wide of the crease Pollard, to angle this way across the left hander. It's a length ball, a cutter, leaving Perera, He tries to push that into the offside and is beaten by the extra bounce the cutter gets"
29.3,1,"Pollard to Mendis, 1 run, length on the pads, turned around the corner to fine leg"
29.2,0,"Pollard to Mendis, no run, full outside off. Bunted into the ground. Mendis is having a look at him first."
29.1,0,"Pollard to Mendis, no run, length ball on the stumps, defended into the legside."
28.6,4,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, oh dear. This is a poor finish to a poor over. Short again, on the hip. Perera swivel pulls that fine of fine leg, and collects an easy, easy boundary. Fourteen off the over.  The biggest of the innings so far."
28.5,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, short of a length ball, well outside off. Mendis fends this away to third man for a single."
28.4,4,"Holder to Mendis, FOUR runs, short ball, and those are sitting up beautifully, especially at Holder's pace. Mendis is on to this in a flash, going back to pull this brutally, well in front of square. Fabian Allen dives to try and stop that, but the ball is traveling too quickly, and it hits his body and runs over the rope"
28.3,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, length ball, cutter I think, and Mendis tries to run it off the face, but can only get an under edge to that. Bouncers to the keeper"
28.2,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, full ball, clipped away into a gap around midwicket"
28.1,4,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, FOUR runs, short, on the stumps, and Kusal has basically bullied that to the wide long on boundary. He makes room and bashes that aerially to the boundary, putting Holder under pressure early in the over"
27.6,0,"Chase to Mendis, no run, full and on off stump, pushed back to the bowler."
27.5,2,"Chase to Mendis, 2 runs, flatter and faster, outside off stump. Mendis goes back and cuts it past point, and they take two ."
27.4,1,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, tossed up, sliding on with the arm on about middle. Perera tries to defend but it takes a thick inside edge and dribbles into the legside. They scamper one."
27.3,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, shorter this time, and Mendis goes back and short-arm pulls this to deep square leg. More work for Cottrell"
27.2,4,"Chase to Mendis, FOUR runs, too leg-side-ish, and Mendis brings out the sweep again, and nails it past short fine leg. No chance for Cottrell to cut that off."
27.1,2,"Chase to Mendis, 2 runs, floated up, swept hard and flat by Kusal Mendis for a couple to deep square leg. Good work from Cottrell on the boundary"
26.6,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, worked off his pad to square leg"
26.5,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, looks to pull but the ball goes over his head"
26.4,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, defended"
26.3,0,"Holder to Mendis, no run, full ball, hits his pads, but sliding down leg"
26.2,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, driven to lon on"
26.1,4,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 4 leg byes, full, down the leg side, and gets some pad to fine leg"

25.4,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, "
25.3,1,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, lobs this over extra cover"
25.2,3,"Chase to Mendis, 3 runs, work for the fielder at backward point as he guides this fine. Enough time to come back for three"
25.1,1,"Chase to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, full outside off stump and defended"
24.6,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 run, good length, outside off. Slapped to mid off for a single"
24.5,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, worked to square leg"
24.4,1,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, 1 leg bye, appeal for lbw but not given. Ball stays low as he tries to play cross-batted. Misses the shot, hits him above the pads, and rolls away to point"
24.3,0,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, no run, good length, on middle, and guided to point"
24.2,0,"Holder to MDKJ Perera, no run, good length, on middle. And angling away. Punched to extra cover"
24.1,1,"Holder to Mendis, 1 run, back of a length, on off, and pulled off the back foot to the sweeper fielder"
23.6,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, full, on off. Pushed past the bowler to long on"

19.3,1,"Chase to Mendis, 1 run, plenty happening as Mendis scurries to defend towards the bowler. Chase runs across smartly, collects with one hand and throws it to the keeper trying to effect a run-out. But the throw is awry, first slip can't back up either, so all the good work goes to waste. Overthrows"

19.1,7,"Chase to Karunaratne, OUT, has he hurt himself there? Ball pops up as Karunaratne looks to defend. Lobbed in the air and Chase has to dive forward to take the catch. Looks like the delivery got held up off the deck. Chase looks better now..."

7.5,2,"Holder to Karunaratne, 2 runs, another lovely push, this one square of the wicket. Holder goes a touch shorter and a little wider this time, and Karunaratne shuffles towards it and punches it past point off the back foot. Not overhitting it. It gets reeled in just before the boundary."
7.4,0,"Holder to Karunaratne, no run, length outside off, stands tall and punches it straight to cover"

33.1,2,"McCarthy to Lewis, 2 runs, full, slanting away from off stump. Lewis drives with an open face, and he threads it past backward point, but has he hit it too well?

32.6,0,"Rankin to Pollard, no run, shuffles down the pitch to a length ball outside off, and defends into the point region"
32.5,7,"Rankin to Chase, OUT, whoa, that came out of nowhere. This pitch has always had this in it. Digs it in short, and gets it to bounce brutally in the fourth-stump channel.

29.2,0,"McCarthy to Lewis, no run, length ball on middle and leg, defended towards mid-on"
29.1,2,"McCarthy to Lewis, 2 runs, a rare mishit from Lewis. Length ball slanting across to off stump. Wanted to hit over mid-off, but the length and the angle caused him to slice it high over point instead. Doesn't carry all the way to the sweeper, though"

5.6,2,"McCarthy to Lewis, 2 runs, "
5.5,7,"McCarthy to Hope, OUT, gone, extra bounce does Hope in. Digs this in short, just outside off, and it gets up near his right shoulder. A tough place to pull from, and he only manages a top-edge that balloons high in the air before landing in the hands of Porterfield running to his left from midwicket and diving to take it a couple of feet from the ground"
5.4,1,"McCarthy to Lewis, 1 run, shortish, a bit more width than the last few balls. Reaches out for a checked uppercut that hangs in the air for a while but safely to the right of backward point"

5.2,0,"McCarthy to Lewis, no run, back of a length, slanting away from off stump, and some extra bounce causes Lewis a bit of discomfort. Handles it well enough, dropping his wrists down on top of the bounce to keep it down in front of point"
5.1,0,"McCarthy to Lewis, no run, length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"

3.5,4,"McCarthy to Hope, FOUR runs, even better? This isn't a contest, and we aren't comparing. Not a half-volley at all, but a bit of width, and Hope leans forward to drive on the up through cover point, from where a fielder had just been moved into the leg side"

36.2,0,"Joseph to McBrine, no run, mean bouncer. Right up the front shoulder. Rapidly up and McBrine fends inside the line. It hits his shoulder and lobs to the keeper's left"
36.1,1,"Joseph to Tucker, 1 run, short of a length and just outside off. Steered to third man"
35.6,1,"Walsh to Tucker, 1 run, googly tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"

35.3,1,"Walsh to McBrine, 1 run, googly, length and outside leg. Flicked down to deep backward square"
35.2,7,"Walsh to Adair, OUT, completely beaten in flight! Walsh gets this to dip. He's bowled it from about a foot-and-a-half behind the crease. Just short of a good length outside off. Adair might not have stood a chance in any case after stepping out, because he was looking to flick this through the leg side as it spun away from him. Hope's happy day behind the stumps continues, he makes no mistake"

34.6,1,"Joseph to Adair, 1 run, shortish, close to off stump, chopped away through point"
34.5,0,"Joseph to Adair, no run, dropped. Another firmly struck pull from Adair, off a short ball on off stump, but he hits it within range of Pollard at midwicket. He dives right and gets both hands to it, but the ball pops out as his elbows hit the turf"

34.3,1,"Joseph to Adair, 1 run, full on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg"
34.2,4,"Joseph to Adair, FOUR runs, shot. This short one doesn't get up that high, on off stump, and Adair picks the length early and hammers a pull out to the midwicket boundary"
34.1,0,"Joseph to Adair, no run, shortish on off stump, blocked into the covers. Extra bounce, and he takes the bottom hand off to ensure he keeps it down with soft hands"

33.5,1,"Chase to Adair, 1 run, down the track and he isn't quite to the pitch of this offbreak angled in from wide of the crease. Slogged on the bounce to deep midwicket"

33.1,0,"Chase to Adair, no run, full outside off, driven into the covers"
32.6,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, extra bounce. Looks for the reverse-sweep again and the ball spins and bounces past his edge. A polite appeal for caught-behind from keeper and bowler. Bat may have scraped the ground. It's sent upstairs to check on the stumping as well, but he never dragged his foot out in the first place"
32.5,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, goes back to a length ball on middle and leg, defends it back to the bowler"
32.4,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, a bit of flight on off stump, stretches out to block it back to the bowler"

32.2,1,"Walsh to Tucker, 1 bye, ooh, so close! Dangled up outside off and he doesn't pick the googly at all. Goes for the big cover drive, and it spins back in through the gate, misses off stump, and Hope fumbles to allow a bye"
32.1,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, flat legbreak, goes back and defends as it turns from middle to off"
31.6,6,"Chase to Adair, SIX runs, down the track, and that's a super shot. Gets close to the pitch of this flighted ball drifting away from off stump, and uses a shovelling motion of his bottom hand to generate the power he needs to launch it high over the straight long-off boundary"
31.5,1,"Chase to Tucker, 1 run, low full-toss outside off, driven to long-off"
31.4,0,"Chase to Tucker, no run, fullish on off stump, gets forward to block it back to the bowler"
31.3,0,"Chase to Tucker, no run, ooh, risky. Makes room to cut against the turn, and the ball keeps low and misses off stump by inches"
31.2,1,"Chase to Adair, 1 run, flatter, spins into the stumps, clipped into the square leg region"
31.1,0,"Chase to Adair, no run, tossed up, not too far outside off. Looks to reverse-sweep and can't get it past backward point. Ends up slipping and doing the splits in the process of stretching forward to play the shot"
30.6,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, flat and fullish on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
30.6,1,"Walsh to Tucker, 1 wide, angles this down leg, and Tucker can't connect with the attempted paddle-sweep"

30.4,1,"Walsh to Adair, 1 run, tossed up outside off, swept along the ground to deep square leg"
30.3,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, this is the googly. Back of a length, spinning back towards off stump. Goes back and chops it to backward point"
30.2,1,"Walsh to Tucker, 1 run, loopy and full on off stump, driven to long-off. Wonder if he was trying the wrong'un"
30.1,1,"Walsh to Adair, 1 run, flat legbreak close to off stump, goes back and punches to deep point"

29.4,0,"Chase to Tucker, no run, flatter now, similar line outside off, defended off the front foot"
29.3,0,"Chase to Tucker, no run, tossed up outside off, and Tucker, looking to reverse-sweep, plays too early. Ball bounces a little more than expected and hits his bicep"
29.2,1,"Chase to Adair, 1 run, flighted ball angling into middle stump, clipped to long-on"
29.1,1,"Chase to Tucker, 1 run, back of a length, spinning in towards off stump, punched to long-off"

28.4,0,"Paul to Tucker, no run, length ball on off stump, defended into the cover point region"
28.3,1,"Paul to Adair, 1 run, full, on a wide-ish line outside off. Gets forward without his head getting over the ball, and ends up reaching out with his hands to drive. Thick outside edge runs away to the left of the diving backward point fielder"
28.2,0,"Paul to Adair, no run, back of a length on off stump, gets on top of the bounce and defends into the covers"
28.1,0,"Paul to Adair, no run, length ball on middle and leg, shows the full face to punch to mid-on"

27.2,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, fuller, punched into the covers"
27.1,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, nicely bowled. Dangled up outside off, and it dips and turns sharply with some extra bounce. Adair was forward, looking to defend, and he ended up playing a long way inside the line"
26.6,0,"Paul to Tucker, no run, another yorker, on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
26.5,0,"Paul to Tucker, no run, in the blockhole on middle stump, jams his bat down and digs it out to midwicket"
26.4,0,"Paul to Tucker, no run, length ball on off stump, defended to cover"
26.3,1,"Paul to Adair, 1 run, full outside off, driven to the left of mid-off. Was looking for the gap between cover and mid-off and he couldn't quite find it"
26.2,0,"Paul to Adair, no run, full now, close to off stump, gets forward for a checked drive to mid-off"
26.1,1,"Paul to Tucker, 1 run, back of a length on off stump. Lets it come to him and dabs gently towards backward point"

25.5,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, flat length ball on off stump, gets back to defend to straight midwicket"

25.3,1,"Walsh to Adair, 1 run, length ball on off stump, defended with an open face into the backward point region"
25.2,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, flatter, on off stump, still quite full. Blocked back to the bowler"

24.5,4,"Cottrell to Tucker, FOUR runs, back of a length, angling down leg, and Tucker gets a nice bit of wood onto the flick off the hips, and sends it racing to the fine leg boundary"
24.4,0,"Cottrell to Tucker, no run, full, angling in towards off stump, defended to cover"
24.3,0,"Cottrell to Tucker, no run, full, angling in from wide of the crease. Gets forward and opens his bat face to steer to backward point"

24.1,1,"Cottrell to Tucker, 1 run, shortish on middle and leg, tucked away to deep square leg"
23.6,1,"Walsh to Tucker, 1 run, nicely bowled. Slower, on middle stump. Looks for the drive to long-on and the ball dips and turns and takes a thick edge and rolls towards backward point instead"
23.5,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, flat legbreak pitching on off stump. Goes back and punches firmly, and the bowler moves to his left to stop the single to long-off"

23.3,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, nice length on off stump, gets forward and opens the face to dab with the turn to backward point"

22.5,7,"Cottrell to Simi Singh, OUT, back of a length, leg-stumpish, and that's a soft dismissal to send back Singh. Looks to tuck it fine, only manages a thin inside edge to Hope"
22.4,0,"Cottrell to Simi Singh, no run, back of a length on off stump, punched to cover"
22.3,1,"Cottrell to Tucker, 1 leg bye, mild lbw shout as Tucker misses the flick. Ball pitched well outside leg, though"

20.4,0,"Cottrell to Simi Singh, no run, full now, on that middle-and-leg line again. Looks to flick and inside-edges into his pad"
20.3,0,"Cottrell to Simi Singh, no run, back of a length on middle and leg, defended into the on side"
20.2,7,"Cottrell to Porterfield, OUT, gone. Short, wide, it was there to cut, but he thrashed too hard at it without necessarily attaining a firm base, and ends up top-edging thickly to the keeper"
20.1,1,"Cottrell to Tucker, 1 run, length ball, angling across to middle stump, clipped away to long leg"
19.6,0,"Chase to Porterfield, no run, nicely flighted outside off. Looks for the drive to long-off but he has to reach for the ball, and his bottom hand takes over to close the face slightly and send the ball back to the bowler instead"
19.5,0,"Chase to Porterfield, no run, back of a length close to off stump. Makes a bit of room and cuts firmly, but can't beat backward point"

18.6,0,"Joseph to Porterfield, no run, back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"

18.4,0,"Joseph to Porterfield, no run, length ball outside off, pushed into the covers"
18.3,1,"Joseph to Tucker, 1 run, shortish in the corridor outside off. He's a pretty tall man, Tucker, and he gets on top of the bounce without really having to get on his toes. Taps down on the ball and places it to the right of the lone slip fielder"

17.4,4,"Chase to Porterfield, FOUR runs, flat, angling down leg, and Porterfield puts it away, getting down low to sweep, and just helping it with the angle to the left of the diving backward square leg fielder. Could have stopped that, Alzarri Joseph"
17.3,0,"Chase to Porterfield, no run, flat length ball close to off stump. Punched firmly but extra-cover dives right and stops it to deny any runs"
17.2,1,"Chase to Tucker, 1 run, nicely tossed up outside off, driven down to long-off. The ball dipped on the batsman a little, but he controlled the drive well despite not being right up to the pitch of it"
17.1,1,"Chase to Porterfield, 1 run, looped up nicely outside off, chipped in the air, over the leaping short extra-cover fielder, down to wide long-off"
16.6,0,"Joseph to Tucker, no run, length ball angling in towards off stump. Good stride forward to block it back where it came from"
16.5,0,"Joseph to Tucker, no run, shortish, a bit of width, and he punches it crisply but can't beat Walsh diving right at backward point"
16.4,0,"Joseph to Tucker, no run, back of a length close to off stump, defended towards backward point"
16.3,0,"Joseph to Tucker, no run, back of a length on off stump. Plays nice and late to dab gently into the point region, and looks at his partner to ask if a single is available. It isn't, as the fielder from backward point hares in super quick"
16.2,0,"Joseph to Tucker, no run, shortish now, in the corridor, jumps to ride the bounce and defend into the backward point region"
16.2,1,"Joseph to Tucker, 1 wide, goes full again to welcome the new batsman, but it slides down the leg side, too fast for Tucker to tuck away to the leg side"
16.1,7,"Joseph to O'Brien, OUT, and there's his third wicket! O'Brien's lack of footwork does him in. Hangs back to a fullish delivery angled into the stumps, and instead shuffles across and looks to work it across the line. He misses, the ball hits his front pad, and it's struck him in line and looks dead-on to hit a good chunk of the stumps too. Doesn't review, just walks off. As he should - struck in front of middle and off, crashing into leg stump, according to ball-tracking."

15.3,0,"Chase to O'Brien, no run, tossed up outside off, gets forward and reaches out to drive. Shouts of catch it as the ball hangs briefly in the air, but it doesn't carry to extra-cover"
15.2,2,"Chase to O'Brien, 2 runs, back of a length, close to off stump, not much turn. Stays back and chops it away through point"

14.3,7,"Joseph to Delany, OUT, taken low to his left by Shai Hope. Short of a length just outside off. Gets on the back foot and has a hoick at this, probably expecting a bit more bounce. It's not short enough. Skids thigh height and takes the under-edge, and Hope lunges nicely to hold on"
14.2,0,"Joseph to Delany, no run, length at off stump, defended on the back foot"
14.1,0,"Joseph to Delany, no run, Porterfield nearly run out! Evin Lewis can't get the direct hit in. Length ball just outside off, defended in front of point with soft hands.

12.3,0,"Joseph to Porterfield, no run, short of a length at the mid-riff, looks to pull and cops it on the body"

8.6,1,"Joseph to Balbirnie, 1 run, short of a length at leg stump, nudged to fine leg off the inside edge"
8.5,6,"Joseph to Balbirnie, SIX runs, launched over the long leg boundary! Short ball at the chest. It's looked a slow-ish pitch so far and the hook and pull have been good options. Balbirnie hooks from in front of his body and makes no attempt to keep this down"

7.5,0,"Paul to Balbirnie, no run, length on off, defended on the back foot"
7.4,4,"Paul to Balbirnie, FOUR runs, short and in at the hips. Doesn't quite rise so he does well to wait on this, watch it closely, and close the wrists late to steer it to the fine leg boundary with a pull"
7.3,0,"Paul to Balbirnie, no run, short at the body, ducks to let it go"

7.1,0,"Paul to Balbirnie, no run, length and angled in at middle stump. Punched to mid-on"
6.6,0,"Joseph to Delany, no run, bouncer up at the right shoulder. A tad too short to make him play. Gets the head out of the way to let that go"

4.6,0,"Cottrell to Stirling, no run, full and wide outside off, looks to drive through the covers and misses the ball"
4.5,0,"Cottrell to Stirling, no run, full and just outside off, driven to cover on the front foot"

3.4,1,"Paul to Stirling, 1 run, slower short ball at middle stump, pulled uppishly to deep square's leg. Cottrell does a lovely balancing act running to his left, picking it up on the bounce just inches in from the boundary and then throwing it back in quickly to keep them to a single, although the batsmen had some part in that being only one too"
3.4,1,"Paul to Stirling, 1 no ball, length and just outside off, slight late movement away, punched on the rise to mid-off"
3.3,0,"Paul to Stirling, no run, length at off stump, defended from the crease"
3.2,2,"Paul to Stirling, 2 runs, length on leg stump, leans in and flicks to deep square's left"

2.6,0,"Cottrell to Delany, no run, length on off, solidly defended on the back foot"
2.5,0,"Cottrell to Delany, no run, leading edge as he closes the face too early on this flick. Short of a length ball stuck at a leg stump line"
2.4,4,"Cottrell to Delany, FOUR runs, oh lovely balance there. Fractionally short on middle stump, gets his weight onto his toes and gets on top of the bounce before pulling along the floor to the square leg boundary"
2.3,0,"Cottrell to Delany, no run, length on middle stump, defended on the back foot"
2.2,0,"Cottrell to Delany, no run, beaten. Ungainly slash from Delaney, no feet movement at all. This was a full ball pushed across him"
2.1,0,"Cottrell to Delany, no run, short of a length and just outside off, defended on the back foot"
1.6,0,"Paul to Stirling, no run, length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
1.5,1,"Paul to Delany, 1 run, back of a length outside off, hops across and steers it neatly to third man to get off the mark in the format"
1.5,1,"Paul to Delany, 1 wide, short, angling down leg. Delany can't put bat to ball as he looks to pull"
1.4,0,"Paul to Delany, no run, back of a length, close to off stump, gets on his toes and dabs to backward point"
1.3,0,"Paul to Delany, no run, length ball, nice teasing line outside off. Left alone"
1.2,4,"Paul to Delany, FOUR runs, back of a length, fourth-stump line. No feet from Delany, just pokes at it with a vertical bat and a thick edge ends up running away between the keeper and first slip"
1.1,0,"Paul to Delany, no run, back of a length, fairly wide of off, and Delaney leaves his first ball in ODI cricket"
0.6,0,"Cottrell to Stirling, no run, beauty. He's got a few to curl back just a hint, and this one keeps going with the angle to beat Stirling's back-foot defensive. Excellent first over. Replays show it hit a crack and actually nipped away"
0.5,0,"Cottrell to Stirling, no run, yikes, that bounced from nowhere. Back of a length, angling across, and it leaps up and beats the outside edge as Stirling shapes to punch through the covers while off his feet"
0.4,2,"Cottrell to Stirling, 2 runs, full again, angling away from off stump. Gets forward and jabs through point"
0.3,0,"Cottrell to Stirling, no run, length ball, angling across towards middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
0.2,0,"Cottrell to Stirling, no run, still pretty full, but not as full as the previous one, and Stirling leaves it alone"
0.1,2,"Cottrell to Stirling, 2 runs, full, angling across to off stump. Leans into a checked drive through cover point"
49.5,6,"Adair to Cottrell, SIX runs, sealed with a six, Sheldon Cottrell! He sized up for the big shot by opening his stance, got a full delivery outside off and he tonked it over the covers. The Kensington Oval has erupted, Ian Bishop is screaming on the mike"
49.4,1,"Adair to Walsh, 1 run, oh my goodness, there's more drama. We're not done yet! Walsh struck the full toss into the covers and didn't take off for the second at all, but Cottrell turned around and ran three-fourths of the second. The throw is in at the bowler's end when it should have been at the keeper's, Cottrell is on another planet, but the bowler doesn't collect the ball, he loses balance, Cottrell slips while turning around and he eventually makes it by the time the ball reaches the keeper's end."
49.3,1,"Adair to Cottrell, 1 run, that's very close, has Cottrell made it at the bowler's end? He pushed the ball down the ground, short cover put in a dive to his right and quickly threw the ball too, at the bowler's end. Hardly any time for Cottrell to make it. Direct hit and he was gone. Cottrell's bat is nowhere near the crease when the bails are dislodged but the third umpire wants to make sure that the ball is still in the bowler's hand when the stumps are broken. He's asking for different angles, he wants the zoom, he wants to rock and roll. Give him everything, I say! We have the zoom and it seems that the ball is popping out of the hands when the stumps are broken. The ball is hitting the stumps, in my view, this should be out. I wonder if Ruchira Palliyaguruge would have taken so much time and replays if so much was not at stake. Oh, he says the evidence is not conclusive, because he's not sure if the ball was in the hands or not when the stumps were broken. He gives the benefit of the doubt to the batsman, not out it is, the match goes on!"
49.2,1,"Adair to Walsh, 1 run, tries a yorker and Walsh drives it down to long on"
49.1,0,"Adair to Walsh, no run, low full toss driven down hard and mid-off goes to his left to fire in a throw"
48.6,0,"McBrine to Cottrell, no run, covers the stumps by moving across and defends the flatter delivery by closing the face of the bat"
48.5,0,"McBrine to Cottrell, no run, full on off, he drives it to mid off"
48.4,1,"McBrine to Walsh, 1 run, driven down to long off and they've taken a single"
48.3,0,"McBrine to Walsh, no run, on middle and leg, he drives it back, it deflects off the bowler's  right hand but goes to cover"

48.1,0,"McBrine to Walsh, no run, leans forward and taps the ball to point"

47.5,0,"Adair to Cottrell, no run, tries to target the stumps but it's gone towards leg stump, he's stuck on the pad in front of leg, no run"
47.4,7,"Adair to Joseph, OUT, and he's chipped a catch to midwicket because of the pace variation! Slower delivery, short too, so it takes time to reach Joseph who has opened his stance already and then slaps the ball gently to midwicket. Like a friendly slap"
47.3,4,"Adair to Joseph, FOUR runs, and again, this time a more elegant straight drive! Pitched up, in the slot, and he drove that with a complete straight bat, high elbow and what not"
47.2,4,"Adair to Joseph, FOUR runs, smashed down the ground for a cracking four! That's the shot of a top batsman. It wasn't all that full, but it was in that line outside off and Joseph swing hard down the ground with a big follow through"
47.1,1,"Adair to Walsh, 1 run, on length on the stumps, driven into the covers"
46.6,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, has the keeper dropped it? Joseph went back to push it on the off side, the ball turned from back of length, the pad in front of off stump, some gap between bat and pad and the ball may have taken the inside edge. Replays are not really conclusive"
46.5,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, this time Joseph takes it on the pad as the ball turns when he goes on the back foot"
46.5,1,"McBrine to Joseph, 1 wide, sharp turn outside leg and it's a wide down the leg side"
46.4,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, on the stumps and driven down again"
46.3,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, drives on the off side, bit of side edge excites Ireland"
46.2,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, loud appeal for bat and pad, Ireland think they have Joseph but the ball only lobbed off the pad towards short leg where the keeper caught it. Bat also hit the pad"
46.1,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, on the stumps and it's driven down to mid off"
45.6,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, angles the length ball away, beats the outside edge with a good delivery but it's not enough"

45.3,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, accurate on middle stump now, he steers it to cover"
45.2,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, "
45.1,1,"McCarthy to Joseph, 1 run, could've been a run out but they come back and eventually take one for the overthrow! Flicked to midwicket, Joseph hares out and is sent back, keeper collects the throw from short midwicket and throws it at the stumps but misses and concedes one"
44.6,0,"Adair to Walsh, no run, some more room now outside off, he drives and misses"
44.5,0,"Adair to Walsh, no run, outside off on length and he lets it go"
44.4,0,"Adair to Walsh, no run, on length outside off, he pushes into the covers"
44.3,1,"Adair to Joseph, 1 run, rising short ball gets the top edge, and falls just wide of backward point! Joseph was surprised by the steep bounce there, he stuck his bat in front of him and the edge lobbed to the left of point but he didn't dive to get to it. Wasn't very far"
44.2,0,"Adair to Joseph, no run, steers the back of length ball to point now"
44.1,0,"Adair to Joseph, no run, driven elegantly into the covers off the front foot"
43.6,1,"McCarthy to Joseph, 1 run, such is Joseph's confidence that he taps the ball towards short cover and takes a quick single to keep strike"
43.5,0,"McCarthy to Joseph, no run, pretty tight with that off stump line and Joseph does well to push it to cover point"
43.4,0,"McCarthy to Joseph, no run, the bowler and keeper appeal loudly for lbw but it's hit Joseph's front pad in front of leg and was probably going down leg"
43.3,1,"McCarthy to Walsh, 1 run, goes on his toes to run this back of length ball to third man for one"
43.2,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, 123kmh, length delivery on off, driven straight to cover"

42.4,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, drives it straight to cover this time"
42.3,4,"McBrine to Joseph, FOUR runs, oh, confident shot from Joseph, and so good-looking! Short of length means he can go back and then punches that with a high elbow to pierce the gap for four"
42.2,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, he leans forward and blocks the delivery from length"
42.2,1,"McBrine to Joseph, 1 wide, and he turns it down the leg side for a wide, good take by the keeper"

41.5,2,"Rankin to Walsh, 2 runs, fullish on the pads, flicked wide of fine leg now for two more"
41.4,2,"Rankin to Walsh, 2 runs, chipped in the air and just over midwicket. A risky shot from Walsh as he flicked it in the air, midwicket ran back for the catch but it was outside his reach, and they take another risk by going for the second"
41.4,1,"Rankin to Walsh, 1 wide, there's a sound down the leg side, the Ireland players go up in celebration for caught behind, the umpire takes a few seconds and calls it a wide! Ireland want a review. Short of length down the leg side, he wanted to tuck it away fine, and UltraEdge shows there was nothing despite the noise. Great decision by Illingworth"
41.3,0,"Rankin to Walsh, no run, short ball, not too quick, and he lets it go over his eye level"
41.2,0,"Rankin to Walsh, no run, fullish on middle, pushed to cover this time"

40.1,0,"McBrine to Walsh, no run, well outside off and turning away, he lets it go"

39.1,0,"Rankin to Walsh, no run, there's an appeal for caught behind, there was a noise, down the leg side. Umpire says no as the bat hit the ground or ball took the pad"
38.6,0,"McBrine to Joseph, no run, turning into Joseph, he helps the ball to midwicket"
38.5,7,"McBrine to Pierre, OUT, edged to slip! The fifty partnership is broken, Ireland are back in the game. McBrine gets a bit of turn with a length delivery, Pierre stays back and wants to push it to off but only gets an outside edge to slip where it goes straight into Stirling's safe hands"
38.4,0,"McBrine to Pierre, no run, pulls the length back a bit, he reaches out to tap to point and sends Walsh back"
38.3,0,"McBrine to Pierre, no run, full on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
38.2,1,"McBrine to Walsh, 1 run, full on off, driven down to long off for one more and that's the team 200. Big cheer from the crowd"
38.1,1,"McBrine to Pierre, 1 run, some turn around off, he opens the face for a quick single towards point"

37.6,1,"Rankin to Walsh, 1 wide, a bouncer nearly down the leg side, called wide for the height by square leg umpire"
37.5,0,"Rankin to Walsh, no run, into the rib cage with a short ball. Walsh hops, tries to defend and gets an inner edge onto his body"
37.4,1,"Rankin to Pierre, 1 run, towards leg again, worked to fine leg for one now"
37.3,1,"Rankin to Walsh, 1 run, just wide of short midwicket and Walsh survives! Back of length towards the hips and the extra bounce beats Walsh who lobs the ball to the leg side and Balbirnie leaps to his right but can't get there"

36.1,1,"McBrine to Pierre, 1 run, some flight and drift towards leg stump, driven into the off side for one"

33.5,1,"Adair to Walsh, 1 run, shorter length outside off and he helps it to third man"
33.4,4,"Adair to Walsh, FOUR runs, driven nicely through the covers as Walsh goes down on a knee for that half-volley and he pierces the gap"
33.3,1,"Adair to Pierre, 1 run, slower towards middle stump, the short length allows him to tuck the ball to leg"

31.1,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, in two minds there, Walsh. It's that nagging line outside off, and he withdraw his bat a little late"

29.6,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, back of length and coming in, he defends it towards off off the back foot"
29.5,4,"McCarthy to Walsh, FOUR runs, edged through slips for four! It's that tempting length outside off, he makes the batsman drive, gets the outside edge but it flies between first slip and gully"

29.3,0,"McCarthy to Walsh, no run, on good length and drivable length outside off, he leaves it again"

28.4,7,"Simi Singh to Shepherd, OUT, taken at midwicket! The slip fielder had just moved to midwicket, and Simi Singh darts in a flat and quick delivery. It wasn't a great ball, was very short, but the pace hardly gave Shepherd any time to go back and pull properly. Doesn't middle it and Stirling dives to his right for a good, low catch"

27.5,7,"McCarthy to Pollard, OUT, caught and bowled! That might be the game! McCarthy goes short. It sticks in the pitch. The ball hasn't done that all night. But it does now. Pollard is early into his flick. It lobs off the splice of his bat. McCarthy rushes forward, dives to his right, gets it in both hands and is instantly mobbed by his team-mates"

26.1,7,"Simi Singh to Pooran, OUT, bowled im! Lovely work from Singh, coming from around the wicket, angling the ball so sharply into the left-hander. It pitches on leg stump. Pooran plays for a bit of turn, but there's way more than he bargains for. His outside edge is beaten and his stumps take a hit"

25.2,1,"Rankin to Pooran, 1 run, allows the short ball to come to him and dabs it behind point"
25.1,0,"Rankin to Pooran, no run, full on middle, defends"
24.6,6,"Simi Singh to Pollard, SIX runs, he cleared the ground two-handed, so he goes one-handed this time and it's the same result. Well nearly, this time he only clears the rope (at long-on) To think Singh had actually deceived him with the ball dipping in front of him, forcing him to reach out..."
24.5,0,"Simi Singh to Pollard, no run, shortish and outside off, punches it down to the bowler"
24.4,0,"Simi Singh to Pollard, no run, slows it down and tosses it up. Pollard defends"

24.2,0,"Simi Singh to Pollard, no run, clips a good length ball to short fine leg"
24.1,4,"Simi Singh to Pollard, FOUR runs, whips it over short midwicket - possible catching chance, but Pollard strikes this very clean. Stirling is the man close in. Too close in as it turns out"
23.6,4,"Rankin to Pooran, FOUR runs, gets to fifty with a rasping cut shot past backward point. He doesn't really have all that much room to work with, but his bottom hand is so very strong. Enough power there to compensate for lack of room"
23.6,1,"Rankin to Pooran, 1 wide, slides down leg as he hopes to pull it"

21.3,1,"Rankin to Pollard, 1 run, works the shortish ball past midwicket"
21.2,0,"Rankin to Pollard, no run, Pooran could have been run-out! Pollard tries to work the ball to midwicket, but it bounces up a bit more on him, making him mis-hit it. Besides, there's a fielder there, Simi Singh. WI really shouldn't have gone for the single, Pollard eventually sends Pooran back but a direct hit would have had him"

17.3,4,"Delany to Pooran, FOUR runs, long hop now and Pooran hammers it to the deep midwicket fence"
17.2,4,"Delany to Pooran, FOUR runs, thick outside edge and it's gone to the boundary too! Pooran is tempted by the width and throws his bat at it, looking to hit through the covers, instead it goes past short third man"

8.5,7,"Rankin to King, OUT, loud appeal after a sound for caught behind, finger goes up, he's not reviewing. The delivery nipped in after pitching outside off and looks like it touched the inside edge before landing in the gloves. The Ireland players are very confident, King goes up to Hope and with only a few seconds left to review, he decides not to and Hope cannot believe it.

37.3,1,"Walsh to Adair, 1 run, no turn this time - possibly intentional - and Adair rocks back and cuts to deep point"
37.2,1,"Walsh to Simi Singh, 1 run, pushes it through on middle, he shifts across and flicks to deep square leg"
37.1,1,"Walsh to Adair, 1 run, goes back and punches a good length ball to long-on"
36.6,0,"Shepherd to Simi Singh, no run, ducks underneath the bouncer"
36.5,4,"Shepherd to Simi Singh, FOUR runs, he's ready for the short ball, and Shepherd doesn't have the same pace as Joseph. Singh pulls past midwicket"

36.3,1,"Shepherd to Adair, 1 run, top edge as he goes for the cut, but it lands safely to the left of the sweeper"

35.6,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, quicker, flatter delivery on leg stump. He defends"
35.5,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, leading edge as he turns the face of the bat looking for midwicket and the ball goes past backward point instead"
35.4,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, shifts back to a slightly flatter delivery and works it to midwikcet"
35.3,1,"Walsh to Simi Singh, 1 run, nudges a length ball on leg stump towards square leg"
35.2,0,"Walsh to Simi Singh, no run, goes back to a good length ball and has to deal with a bit of turn and bounce. Soft hands help him out"
35.1,0,"Walsh to Simi Singh, no run, pushes it through on middle, Singh knocks it down to mid-on"
34.6,1,"Joseph to Simi Singh, 1 run, shapes to pull but it appears as though the ball doesn't bounce as high as he expects, has to change his shot to a flick through square leg."
34.5,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, outstanding drive again as Joseph goes really full on off stump. Mid-off in the way"
34.4,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, back of a length on off stump, defends"
34.3,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, another bouncer - well directed, on off stump, coming up to his throat - and this time he evades it."
34.2,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, on the bounce to a short square leg placed for the bouncer. Singh goes for the pull, doesn't time it, is just a bit lucky"
34.1,2,"Joseph to Simi Singh, 2 runs, smears it to the left of mid-off, King dives and gets a hand to it. Sweet shot though, taking on the half-volley with a straight bat"
33.6,0,"Pierre to Adair, no run, attempts a sweep with the ball angled into him, strikes his pad"

33.4,5,"Pierre to Adair, 5 wides, slides down leg, keeps low, beats the keeper and runs away"
33.3,1,"Pierre to Simi Singh, 1 run, a hint of width allows him to cut the ball away to deep point"

33.1,0,"Pierre to Simi Singh, no run, backs away to try and open up the off side, but Pierre follows him, spearing the ball into his pads and beating the bat"
32.6,0,"Joseph to Adair, no run, pushes down to mid-off"
32.5,0,"Joseph to Adair, no run, extra bounce! And with the ball angled into him, he's always in trouble of being caught behind. Good work from Adair to drop his wrists"
32.4,0,"Joseph to Adair, no run, shortish on off stump, defends"
32.3,6,"Joseph to Adair, SIX runs, pummels a back of a length ball away over deep midwicket. Short but not quite rising, just sitting up to be smashed"

31.1,0,"Pierre to Adair, no run, tosses it up on off stump, drives it back to the bowler"
30.6,7,"Joseph to O'Brien, OUT, Joseph does get his wicket in the over, thanks to a needless heave from O'Brien, and the top edge is taken at fine leg. Absolutely no need for that shot, back of length and coming in, he swings the last ball of the over after surviving earlier in the over, doesn't middle it and it goes high enough for Cottrell to run in from fine leg and get under it in time"
30.5,0,"Joseph to O'Brien, no run, back of length outside off, punched into the covers this time"
30.4,0,"Joseph to O'Brien, no run, loud appeal for lbw, given immediately and it's been reviewed straightaway! I think it's too high. O'Brien almost on his toes there, the ball coming in sharply from short of length outside off, hitting him over the knee roll and it's going over the stumps"
30.3,1,"Joseph to Simi Singh, 1 leg bye, short of length outside off, tapped wide of point for one"
30.2,2,"Joseph to Simi Singh, 2 runs, it's the short ball trap, gets the top edge but it falls just to the left of fine leg! Singh went for the hook as the ball rose on him, it went high too, but it was out of Cottrell's reach as he ran in and to his left"
30.1,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, around length outside off, pushed to cover"
29.6,2,"Walsh to O'Brien, 2 runs, back to outside off, he steers it wide of point in the gap for two"

29.4,6,"Walsh to O'Brien, SIX runs, just wide of sweeper cover and it's gone all the way! A half-volley, O'Brien went for a risky inside-out drive and it went to the right of a running and sliding Shepherd, and over the top"
29.3,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, nice length to make him come forward, he gets a very thick outside edge to short third man. Some turn there"
29.2,4,"Walsh to O'Brien, FOUR runs, too short, gives him enough time to hang back and slap-pull it by using the pace of the ball and he beats fine leg for four!"
29.1,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, nicely bowled on middle with some turn towards off, he waits and defends"
28.6,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, brings it in this time towards the stumps, and Singh gets a thick inside edge to the leg side"
28.5,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, shortish outside off, he gets bat and finds point"
28.4,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, a lot of bounce on that one, and it's only 132kmh! Shortest ball to Singh so far, it had a bit of width, he tried to steer it away but it went well over the horizontal bat"
28.3,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, shortish again outside off, he taps it towards cover"
28.2,0,"Joseph to Simi Singh, no run, short of length around off, he stays back expecting the short ball and defends to off"
28.1,7,"Joseph to Tucker, OUT, there's a gully in place and he gets a dolly! Ireland falling apart again. Short ball rising on Tucker, excellent use of height from Joseph. Tucker was taken by surprise and stuck his bat in front of his face, and the leasing edge lobbed up to Lewis' right"
27.6,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, loopy delivery on the stumps now, and pushed back"
27.5,4,"Walsh to O'Brien, FOUR runs, loopy full toss, dipping outside off, and O'Brien drives it with minimal footwork, through the covers and he gets four"
27.4,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, goes back and away and punches this length ball to cover"
27.3,1,"Walsh to Tucker, 1 run, bit of a mix up now as Tucker pushes the ball to mid on and wants a quick one. O'Brien is ball watching and took off very late, but he eventually makes it because of an inaccurate throw"
27.2,0,"Walsh to Tucker, no run, beaten completely by the googly, loud appeal and given. But he's asked for a review as well. Was it turning too much? Beautiful googly turning in from off stump, hitting him on the front pad as the bat was outside the line. Looks very close as we wait for UltraEdge. Looks like the ball just missed the inside edge, it's very close because the bat brushed the pad when the ball crossed it. 'No bat' says the third umpire and ball-tracking says it's going over. The umpire smiles, so does Walsh"
27.1,1,"Walsh to O'Brien, 1 run, flight and some drift towards the batsman's feet, he flicks it for one"
26.6,0,"Joseph to Tucker, no run, stays still in front of off stump to defend the length delivery back"
26.5,7,"Joseph to Stirling, OUT, inside edge and another soft dismissal! Joseph will be pleased with that after his last over. This was a good ball but nowhere near the stumps, pretty short and well outside off, it rises and naps back in sharply, Stirling wants to help it to third man but only manages to edge it to off stump. Instant cry of anguish from him because he has to go back"
26.4,0,"Joseph to Stirling, no run, nice and accurate on off stump, good length, and Stirling defends it back"
26.3,1,"Joseph to O'Brien, 1 run, driven on the up with a thick edge, in between cover and mid-off for one"
26.2,0,"Joseph to O'Brien, no run, even shorter outside off and he goes on his toes again to steer that to point"
26.1,0,"Joseph to O'Brien, no run, short of length outside off, he hops and defends it"
25.6,1,"Walsh to O'Brien, 1 run, slower through the air around middle and off now, nice length, and he lets it turn to help it to point"
25.5,1,"Walsh to Stirling, 1 run, full on off, he drives it down to long off easily"
25.4,1,"Walsh to O'Brien, 1 run, bit more towards middle and he drives it very well again but this time long off cuts it off"
25.3,4,"Walsh to O'Brien, FOUR runs, nicely struck there, inside-out drive for that half-volley and that has raced away to the cover boundary to beat long off"
25.2,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, flat and quick on the stumps, he helps it to point"
25.1,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, low full toss, driven to cover"
24.6,4,"Pierre to Stirling, FOUR runs, just over midiwcket! Looked like Stirling was in two minds there but he ended up cross-batting that delivery from leg stump, it wasn't struck very hard and Cottrell jumped at midwicket but it just escaped him. Lucky for Stirling"
24.5,0,"Pierre to Stirling, no run, pulls the length ball, Stirling wants to sweep it away but misses"
24.4,1,"Pierre to O'Brien, 1 run, and steered between point and cover point once again because of the short length outside off"
24.3,1,"Pierre to Stirling, 1 run, closer to off and slower through the air, driven away square past a diving point fielder for one more"
24.2,1,"Pierre to O'Brien, 1 run, pretty short outside off, gives the batsman enough time to rock back and cut to deep point"
24.1,1,"Pierre to Stirling, 1 run, just a bit of room outside off and it's driven away to sweeper cover"
23.6,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, quicker on leg now, he defends it towards mid on"
23.5,0,"Walsh to O'Brien, no run, full with some room, big swing of the bat from O'Brien but he misses"
23.4,1,"Walsh to Stirling, 1 run, fuller and closer to off, driven down easily to long off"
23.3,1,"Walsh to O'Brien, 1 run, flat and well outside off, short enough to be cut away for one"
23.2,1,"Walsh to Stirling, 1 run, connects nicely with the sweep this time, fuller delivery, and he gets one"
23.1,0,"Walsh to Stirling, no run, appeal first ball! Pollard is going for the review after a loud lbw appeal. Quicker delivery there, going straight after pitching on off Stirling tried to sweep but missed. UltraEdge shows no edge. And ball-tracker says it's turning away from off to miss off stump"
22.6,7,"Pierre to Porterfield, OUT, straight to mid-off. That's just poor shot selection from Porterfield. He was looking good there, Ireland needed that partnership, but he simply handed a straightforward catch off a length delivery to Joseph"
22.5,1,"Pierre to Stirling, 1 run, back of length outside off, punched away through cover"
22.4,1,"Pierre to Porterfield, 1 run, he pulls the length back, and the batsman goes back to work it to leg"
22.3,0,"Pierre to Porterfield, no run, taps the length ball back to the bowler"
22.2,3,"Pierre to Stirling, 3 runs, the slip was taken away and the ball has been edged right through there! Tempting line and length outside off, Stirling falls for the trap and drives for a thick edge. The third umpire is checking if Pooran has done a clean job of keeping the ball in at the boundary, before falling over. He has"
22.1,0,"Pierre to Stirling, no run, tries to sweep it away from off but only gets an inside edge"
21.6,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, slower one to end the over, 116kmh on off stump and he is surprised a bit before pushing it to cover"
21.5,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, pitched up, tempting line to drive, and he drives and misses"
21.4,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, nipping in from fourth stump line, driven back hard to the bowler"
21.3,1,"Cottrell to Stirling, 1 run, quick on the pads, worked away behind square easily for his 24th ODI fifty"
21.2,1,"Cottrell to Porterfield, 1 run, short and wide now, and slapped away with hard hands to sweeper cover"
21.1,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, some room and he swings his arms to send that straight to point"
20.6,1,"Pierre to Porterfield, 1 run, angling in towards off from wide of the crease, pushed down to long-on"
20.5,1,"Pierre to Stirling, 1 run, bit of width, punched just to the right of a dicing cover for one and they're not interested in the overthrow. What if this one run proves costly (I'm not hoping for a tie)"
20.4,0,"Pierre to Stirling, no run, tighter line on off now, he stays still and blocks"
20.3,0,"Pierre to Stirling, no run, punched off the back foot to cover"
20.2,1,"Pierre to Porterfield, 1 run, hint of turn towards off stump, he plays inside the line and gets a thick outside edge to point"
20.1,1,"Pierre to Stirling, 1 run, outside off with some width, drives through the covers for one and some applause for the team's 100"

19.5,1,"Cottrell to Stirling, 1 run, short of length outside of, worked off the hips towards fine leg"

19.3,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, angling in from just outside off, driven down the ground to mid off"
19.2,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, on length outside off, he helps it to point this time"
19.1,0,"Cottrell to Porterfield, no run, on length and towards off stump, he blocks it back"
18.6,1,"Pierre to Porterfield, 1 run, from wide of the crease and darting it in towards middle at 91kmh, worked to midwicket for one"
18.5,0,"Pierre to Porterfield, no run, flatter and quicker towards leg, wants to work it to leg but doesn't connect"
18.4,0,"Pierre to Porterfield, no run, turn again, this time closer to the batsman and he pushes it to cover"
18.3,0,"Pierre to Porterfield, no run, nice flight and some turn outside off, he leaves it alone"
18.2,1,"Pierre to Stirling, 1 run, flatter and wider outside off, cuts it away to deep point"
18.1,4,"Pierre to Stirling, FOUR runs, the fours are pouring! Stirling goes across to extend his arms for the sweep but this is a full toss on middle and he sweeps that away past fine leg for four"
17.6,0,"Joseph to Porterfield, no run, good bounce on that outside off, rising with the angle, and he steers it to point"
17.5,0,"Joseph to Porterfield, no run, driven nicely from outside off, down on a knee, but straight to wide mid-off"
17.5,1,"Joseph to Porterfield, 1 wide, he's been rattled. A wide down the leg side now"
17.4,4,"Joseph to Porterfield, FOUR runs, pulled handsomely, four more! A bit too short, predictable after that half volley, and the batsman jumped right on it to dispatch it to midwicket"
17.3,4,"Joseph to Porterfield, FOUR runs, too full and on off this time, Porterfield drives that down, not very convincingly but he has enough on it for another four"
17.2,0,"Joseph to Porterfield, no run, much better from Joseph, on good length and across with a tighter line. Tries to cut and misses"
17.1,4,"Joseph to Porterfield, FOUR runs, edged and gone through slip! Wide delivery outside off, there was a very wide slip but this thick edge off the drive went where first slip is. Four to Porterfield"
16.6,0,"Pierre to Stirling, no run, tosses it up on middle, defends and that's drinks"
16.5,1,"Pierre to Porterfield, 1 run, rocks back and slaps it to the sweeper"

15.5,0,"Pollard to Stirling, no run, good length on middle, defends"
15.4,4,"Pollard to Stirling, FOUR runs, launches it past cover - Hetmyer dives full length to his right and it just eludes him - and considering Stirling times it very well it goes all the way to the boundary"

8.2,1,"Joseph to Porterfield, 1 run, works it off his hips through midwicket"
8.1,7,"Joseph to Balbirnie, OUT, what a ball! He gets it to nip in off the pitch and middle stump takes a beating. Joseph runs in and unlike the other fast bowlers pitches it up and immediately gets movement. Balbirnie looks to play a drive on the up and his inside edge is beaten"

7.5,0,"Pierre to Stirling, no run, gets a little turn as he pushes it through on off stump. Stirling defends"
7.4,6,"Pierre to Stirling, SIX runs, backs away and lifts it over mid-off and this time there's plenty on it. Incredible shot - it's premeditated, making room for himself, Pierre follows him, but it doesn't matter once he plays with a straight bat"

4.3,7,"Cottrell to Delany, OUT, bounces him out! The ball climbs up towards his armpit. Delany has nowhere to go. He can't evade it. He's cramped. He goes for the pull and he just gloves it to short fine leg"

46.5,7,"Shepherd to McCarthy, OUT, heaved out to the deep ... has he got hold of it.... no, he hasn't! King at wide long-on back-pedals on the edge of the rope, plucks the ball to his chest, and a battling cameo comes to an end. McCarthy did at least hang around to take Ireland's innings deep"

42.5,1,"Joseph to McCarthy, 1 run, whipped off the pads, out to backward square"

39.5,7,"Walsh to Simi Singh, OUT, big appeal and up goes the finger! It was surely hitting the stumps but did it pitch outside leg? We are going to a review...yep, it pitched on leg, and was actually hitting the leg bail according to DRS... another big scalp as Singh falls"

37.5,0,"Walsh to Adair, no run, back of a length, glided to point"
37.4,7,"Walsh to Balbirnie, OUT, soft dismissal! Flighted outside off from Walsh, Balbirnie wasn't to the pitch as the ball bit and left his attempted cover drive, and Chase at point stooped low to end a doughty innings. But is it doughty enough?"

36.6,4,"Joseph to Balbirnie, FOUR runs, blatted back past the bowler! Joseph flinches in his followthrough but can't move his hands quickly enough. It was well wide, in fact, a solid punched drive on a full length. Another excellent stroke, and that will be drinks"

32.6,4,"Walsh to Balbirnie, FOUR runs, rising up onto the toes, clubbed with intent through point! Balbirnie has his first fifty as Ireland captain. How high can he go from here?"

30.4,7,"Walsh to Tucker, OUT, stunning bowling! Straight through the gate as Walsh slips in the googly, on a perfect length, outside off, skimming in past the inside-edge of a hard-handed drive, and clipping the outside of off stump! That's a collector's item, and it ends a half-formed fightback. The umpires check that the ball, not the keeper's gloves dislodged the bails. They were every bit as bamboozled as the batsman!"

25.3,7,"Chase to O'Brien, OUT, inside-out, lofted high out to deep extra cover, and that's a simple take on the edge of the rope! KOB was stretching for the stroke, never quite to the pitch, and Pooran sauntered in for a very big scalp!"

22.3,4,"Thomas to O'Brien, FOUR runs, dug in, 140kph/87mph and O'Brien scoops it leg side... doesn't quite carry to the man running in, then skids past Pooran on the bounce and runs for a boundary!"

17.6,4,"Chase to O'Brien, FOUR runs, slow and loopy, wide of the stumps, larruped through the covers once again! We all know O'Brien has plenty of power but that was classical stuff, high front elbow and dismissed past the infield. Two boundaries in the over to lift Ireland"
